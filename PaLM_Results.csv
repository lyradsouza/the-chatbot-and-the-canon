I could not rest if around my grave I heard the steps of a trembling slave; His shadow above my silent tomb Would make it a place of fearful gloom. I could not rest if I heard the tread Of a coffle gang to the shambles led, And the mother's shriek of wild despair Rise like a curse on the trembling air. I could not sleep if I saw the lash Drinking her blood at each fearful gash, And I saw her babes torn from her breast, Like trembling doves from their parent nest. I'd shudder and start if I heard the bay Of bloodhounds seizing their human prey, And I heard the captive plead in vain As they bound afresh his galling chain. If I saw young girls from their mother's arms Bartered and sold for their youthful charms, My eye would flash with a mournful flame, My death-paled cheek grow red with shame. I would sleep, dear friends, where bloated might Can rob no man of his dearest right; My rest shall be calm in any grave Where none can call his brother a slave. I ask no monument, proud and high, To arrest the gaze of the passers-by; All that my yearning spirit craves, Is bury me not in a land of slaves.",https://poets.org/poem/bury-me-free-land,"Bury me not in a land of slaves, Where the dark-eyed maidens weep, Where the loud bassoon of the free Never swells the air with glee.

But bear me to a free land, Where the oppressed are free, Where the light of learning shines, And the glorious banner waves on high.

It rose So wildly on the air, It seem’d as if a burden’d heart Was breaking in despair. Saw you those hands so sadly clasped— The bowed and feeble head— The shuddering of that fragile form— That look of grief and dread? Saw you the sad, imploring eye? Its every glance was pain, As if a storm of agony Were sweeping through the brain. She is a mother pale with fear, Her boy clings to her side, And in her kyrtle vainly tries His trembling form to hide. He is not hers, although she bore For him a mother’s pains; He is not hers, although her blood Is coursing through his veins! He is not hers, for cruel hands May rudely tear apart The only wreath of household love That binds her breaking heart. His love has been a joyous light That o’er her pathway smiled, A fountain gushing ever new, Amid life’s desert wild. His lightest word has been a tone Of music round her heart, Their lives a streamlet blent in one— Oh, Father! must they part? They tear him from her circling arms, Her last and fond embrace. Oh! never more may her sad eyes Gaze on his mournful face. No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks Disturb the listening air: She is a mother, and her heart Is breaking in despair.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51977/the-slave-mother-56d23017ceaad,"The Slave Mother By Frances Ellen Watkins Harper She stood at the gate, and watched her child With a tearful eye; While the cold wind blew, and the bitter rain Bent her form on high. ""Oh, my son,"" she cried, ""I cannot bear to see Thee go from me; But I know that thou wilt be free, And that is why I let thee flee."" The boy stood by her side, and looked into her face, With a smile of pride; ""I will be free,"" he said, ""and I will come back And bring thee money to buy thyself."" She kissed his forehead, and then she turned away, And watched him go; And the tears ran down her cheeks, as she said, ""Perhaps I shall never see him more."" But the boy was brave, and he went on his way, And he never forgot his mother's words; And he worked and he saved, and at last he came back, And bought his mother's freedom with his gold. Then they were happy together, and they lived in peace Until the day that she died; And she was buried in the churchyard, close by the gate, Where she had stood so long and watched for her child.",860,"Heard you that shriek?

It was the cry of mothers' hearts, For children torn away; Of fathers' hearts, that bled and broke, For sons who could not stay. It was the cry of human hearts, For freedom and for light; A cry that swelled the air with woe, And rent the night with fright. But yet it rose, that cry of pain, Up to the throne of God; And angels heard it as they passed, And wept above the sod. And God looked down from heaven, And saw the cruel wrong; And in His righteous wrath He swore, To right the bondman's wrong.

19,Frances Ellen Watkins Harper,47630,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Woman,Black,Going East,"She came from the East a fair, young bride,","She came from the East a fair, young bride, With a light and a bounding heart, To find in the distant West a home With her husband to make a start. He builded his cabin far away, Where the prairie flower bloomed wild; Her love made lighter all his toil, And joy and hope around him smiled. She plied her hands to life's homely tasks, And helped to build his fortunes up; While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet, Were mingled and mixed in her cup. He sowed in his fields of golden grain, All the strength of his manly prime; Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees, Was as sweet as the dollar's chime. She toiled and waited through weary years For the fortune that came at length; But toil and care and hope deferred, Had stolen and wasted her strength. The cabin changed to a stately home, Rich carpets were hushing her tread; But light was fading from her eye, And the bloom from her cheek had fled. Slower and heavier grew her step, While his gold and his gains increased; But his proud domain had not the charm Of her humble home in the East. Within her eye was a restless light, And a yearning that never ceased, A longing to see the dear old home She had left in the distant East. A longing to clasp her mother's hand, And nestle close to her heart, And to feel the heavy cares of life Like the sun-kissed shadows depart. Her husband was adding field to field, And new wealth to his golden store; And little thought the shadow of death Was entering in at his door. He had no line to sound the depths Of her tears repressed and unshed; Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart Could be starving, but not for bread. The hungry heart was stilled at last; Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.

They lived together in love and peace, And their home was a happy one; But one dark day the husband died, And the young wife was left alone. She wept for her husband, and her heart was sore; But she knew that she must be brave, And she tried to bear her grief with patience. One day, as she was sitting in her lonely home, She heard a knock at the door; And when she opened it, she saw a little child standing there. The child was crying, and the young wife asked her what was the matter; And the child told her that she was lost, and that she did not know where to go. The young wife took pity on the child, and she took her into her home; And she gave her food and a place to sleep, And she treated her as if she were her own. The child was grateful for the young wife's kindness, And she soon learned to love her as a mother. The young wife was happy to have the child with her, And she felt that she was no longer alone. The years passed by, and the child grew up to be a beautiful woman; And the young wife was proud of her, and she loved her as her own daughter. One day, the young woman met a young man, and they fell in love; And they were married, and they lived happily ever after. The young wife was happy to see her daughter so happy, And she knew that she had done her duty well. She lived to a ripe old age, and she was loved and respected by all who knew her; And when she died, she was mourned by all who had known her.

She brought him love and happiness and light, And made his life a thing of joy and delight. But soon the clouds began to gather round, And dark shadows fell upon her path. Her husband's love grew cold and turned to hate, And she was left alone and desolate. She wept and prayed for help, but no one came. She was all alone in the world, and she knew not what to do. Then one day she heard a voice within her say, ""Go to the East, and there you will find peace."" She rose up and went, not knowing where she was going. But she traveled on and on, until at last she came to a faraway land. There she found a little cottage in the woods, and she went inside. The cottage was empty, but it was clean and warm. She sat down by the fire and began to cry. But then she heard a voice say, ""Do not weep, my child. You are safe now."" She looked up and saw a beautiful woman standing in the doorway. The woman smiled at her and said, ""I am here to help you."" The woman took her in and gave her food and a place to sleep. She nursed her back to health, and she taught her how to live in the woods. The woman was kind and gentle, and she became like a mother to the young bride. The bride learned to love the woods, and she found peace and happiness there. She never forgot her husband, but she knew that she could never go back to him. She was content to live in the woods with the woman who had saved her life. And so she lived out the rest of her days in peace and happiness, And she never forgot the lesson she had learned: That even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.",1265,0,0,0,0,FALSE

But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain. They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed So low for long, they never right themselves: You may see their trunks arching in the woods Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows— Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, Whose only play was what he found himself, Summer or winter, and could play alone. One by one he subdued his father's trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer. He learned all there was To learn about not launching out too soon And so not carrying the tree away Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise To the top branches, climbing carefully With the same pains you use to fill a cup Up to the brim, and even above the brim. Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. So was I once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of going back to be. It’s when I’m weary of considerations, And life is too much like a pathless wood Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs Broken across it, and one eye is weeping From a twig’s having lashed across it open. I'd like to get away from earth awhile And then come back to it and begin over. May no fate willfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love: I don’t know where it's likely to go better. I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again.

But where did the sadness go? People wanted to know. They didn’t want it collecting in their elbows or knees then popping up later. The girl who thought of the ponies made a lot of money. Now a month’s supply of pills came in a hard blue case with a handle. You opened it & found the usual vial plus six tiny ponies of assorted shapes & sizes, softly breathing in the Styrofoam. Often they had to be pried out & would wobble a little when first put on the ground. In the beginning the children tried to play with them, but the sharp hooves nicked their fingers & the ponies refused to jump over pencil hurdles. The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens’ gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a pony’s last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy. People would smile & say, “This would have been an awful month for me,” pointing to the glossy palomino trotting energetically around their ankles. Eventually, the ponies were no longer needed. People had learned to imagine their sadness trotting away. & when they wanted something more tangible, they could always go to the racetrack & study the larger horses’ faces.

But the sadness can't help them, Because it's stuck on the moon. So the sadness just watches the people, And it cries. And the tears from the sadness fall down To the earth, And they turn into rain. And the rain helps the flowers grow, And it makes the trees green, And it makes the birds sing. And the people see the rain, And they think, ""Oh, the sadness is gone."" But the sadness is not gone.

Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Nameless here for evermore. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— This it is and nothing more.” Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;— Darkness there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”— Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— ’Tis the wind and nothing more!” Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door— Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore— Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as “Nevermore.” But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before— On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.” Then the bird said “Nevermore.” Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of ‘Never—nevermore’.” But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!— Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted— On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore— Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore— Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting— “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted—nevermore!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven,,6215,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “‘Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.” Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head, I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue. Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean. My fist got hard and my wits got keen. Roamed from town to town to hide my shame, but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars, I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill that man that gave me that awful name. But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had just hit town and my throat was dry. I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew. At an old saloon in a street of mud and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue. Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad from a worn-out picture that my mother had and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye. He was big and bent and gray and old and I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said, ""My name is Sue. How do you do? Now you're gonna die."" Yeah, that's what I told him. Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down but to my surprise he came up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair right across his teeth. And we crashed through the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer. I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when. He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile. I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin', he went for his gun and I pulled mine first. He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile. And he said, ""Son, this world is rough and if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along. So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'. I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's that name that helped to make you strong."" Yeah, he said, ""Now you have just fought one helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do. But you ought to thank me before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue."" Yeah, what could I do? What could I do? I got all choked up and I threw down my gun, called him pa and he called me a son, and I came away with a different point of view and I think about him now and then.

Dear Oregon, It is understandable that you would feel like you are second best to your boyfriend's mother. After all, he puts her first before you, and he cancels plans with you to spend time with her. It is important to remember that your boyfriend's mother is a part of his life, and he loves her. You cannot expect him to cut her out of his life, but you can ask him to make some changes. For example, you could ask him to limit the amount of time he talks to his mother on the phone each day. You could also ask him to make plans with you in advance, so that he is less likely to cancel them at the last minute. It is also important to remember that you are not alone in this situation. Many people feel like they are second best to their partner's parents. If you are struggling to deal with this, you may want to consider talking to a therapist.

They'd cry and scream and say terrible things to each other, and then they'd go their separate ways. And it would be hard, because they'd both lost someone they loved. But it would also be a learning experience, because they'd learn what they wanted in a relationship, and what they didn't. And they'd be better prepared for the next time they fell in love.

When you break up with someone, you learn a lot about yourself and about what you want in a relationship. You also learn how to deal with heartbreak and how to move on.

But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully, Come, you may stand upon my Back and face your distant destiny, But seek no haven in my shadow. I will give you no hiding place down here. You, created only a little lower than The angels, have crouched too long in The bruising darkness Have lain too long Face down in ignorance. Your mouths spilling words Armed for slaughter. The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me, But do not hide your face. Across the wall of the world, A River sings a beautiful song. It says, Come, rest here by my side. Each of you, a bordered country, Delicate and strangely made proud, Yet thrusting perpetually under siege. Your armed struggles for profit Have left collars of waste upon My shore, currents of debris upon my breast. Yet today I call you to my riverside, If you will study war no more. Come, Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs The Creator gave to me when I and the Tree and the rock were one. Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your Brow and when you yet knew you still Knew nothing. The River sang and sings on. There is a true yearning to respond to The singing River and the wise Rock.

You, who gave me my first name, you, Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then Forced on bloody feet, Left me to the employment of Other seekers—desperate for gain, Starving for gold. You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot, You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought, Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare Praying for a dream. Here, root yourselves beside me. I am that Tree planted by the River, Which will not be moved. I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree I am yours—your passages have been paid. Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need For this bright morning dawning for you. History, despite its wrenching pain Cannot be unlived, but if faced With courage, need not be lived again. Lift up your eyes upon This day breaking for you. Give birth again To the dream. Women, children, men, Take it into the palms of your hands, Mold it into the shape of your most Private need. Sculpt it into The image of your most public self. Lift up your hearts Each new hour holds new chances For a new beginning. Do not be wedded forever To fear, yoked eternally To brutishness. The horizon leans forward, Offering you space to place new steps of change.

And you take a stalk that is straight and long, With an expert eye to its worthy points, And you think of the bubbling strains of song That are bound between its pithy joints— Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle, With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle. Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand! And the music’s flow never loud but low Is the concert note of a fairy band. Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.

Then brother Jabez takes the bow, While Ned stands off with Susan Bland, Then Henry stops by Milly Snow And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand, While I pair off with Mandy Biddle, And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. “Salute your partners,” comes the call, “All join hands and circle round,” “Grand train back,” and “Balance all,” Footsteps lightly spurn the ground, “Take your lady and balance down the middle” To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle. So the night goes on and the dance is o’er, And the merry girls are homeward gone, But I see it all in my sleep once more, And I dream till the very break of dawn Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52442/the-corn-stalk-fiddle,"The Corn-Stalk Fiddle By Paul Laurence Dunbar I.

It’s been proven difficult to dance to machine gun fire. Still, my people made a rhythm this way. A way. My people, so still, in the photographs, as corpses. My failure was that I got used to it. I looked at us, mangled under the TIME photographer’s shadow, and stopped thinking, Get up, get up. I saw the graveyard steam in the pinkish dawn and knew the dead were still breathing. Ha.

Long ago, in another life, on an Amtrak through Iowa, I saw, for a few blurred seconds, a man standing in the middle of a field of winter grass, hands at his side, back to me, all of him stopped there save for his hair scraped by low wind.

You get that out now. No shame in breakin’ open. You get that out and I’ll fetch us some tea. Which made me lose it even more. She came back with Lipton in paper cups, her eyes nowhere blue and there. She was silent all the way to Missoula, where she got off and said, patting my knee, God is good. God is good.

I call it watch your mouth. When they zipped my mother in a body bag I whispered: Rose, get out of there. Your plants are dying. Enough is enough. Body, doorway that you are, be more than what I’ll pass through. Stillness. That’s what it was. The man in the field in the red sweater, he was so still he became, somehow, more true, like a knife wound in a landscape painting. Like him, I caved. I caved and decided it will be joy from now on.

One interpretation is that the speaker is feeling embarrassed or ashamed because they are eating the starchy scape. Another interpretation is that the speaker is feeling embarrassed or ashamed because they are blushing. The poem could also be interpreted as a metaphor for something else.

Its heart is an old compass pointing off in four directions. It drags the world along, the world it becomes. My face surfaces in the green beveled glass above the washstand. My handprint in thick black powder on the bedroom shade. Home I could drink like thin fire that gathers like lead in my veins, heart’s armor, the coffee stains. In the dust of the double hollyhock, Theresa, one frail flame eating wind. One slim candle that snaps in the dry grass. Ascending tall ladders that walk to the edge of dusk. Riding a blue cricket through the tumult of the falling dawn. At dusk the gray owl walks the length of the roof, sharpening its talons on the shingles. Grandpa leans back between spoonfuls of canned soup and repeats to himself a word that belongs to a world no one else can remember. The day has not come when from sloughs, the great salamander lumbers through snow, salt, and fire to be with him, throws the hatchet of its head through the door of the three-room house and eats the blue roses that are peeling off the walls. Uncle Ray, drunk for three days behind the jagged window of a new government box, drapes himself in fallen curtains, and dreams that the odd beast seen near Cannonball, North Dakota, crouches moaning at the door to his body. The latch is the small hook and eye. of religion. Twenty nuns fall through clouds to park their butts on the metal hasp. Surely that would be considered miraculous almost anyplace, but here in the Turtle Mountains it is no more than common fact. Raymond wakes, but he can’t shrug them off. He is looking up dark tunnels of their sleeves, and into their frozen armpits, or is it heaven? He counts the points of their hairs like stars. One by one they blink out, and Theresa comes forth clothed in the lovely hair she has been washing all day. She smells like a hayfield, drifting pollen of birch trees. Her hair steals across her shoulders like a postcard sunset. All the boys tonight, goaded from below, will approach her in The Blazer, The Tomahawk, The White Roach Bar where everyone gets up to cut the rug, wagging everything they got, as the one bass drum of The Holy Greaseballs lights a depth charge through the smoke. Grandpa leans closer to the bingo. The small fortune his heart pumps for is hidden in the stained, dancing numbers. The Ping-Pong balls rise through colored lights, brief as sparrows God is in the sleight of the woman’s hand. He walks from Saint Ann’s, limp and crazy as the loon that calls its children across the lake in its broke, knowing laughter. Hitchhiking home from the Mission, if he sings, it is a loud, rasping wail that saws through the spine of Ira Comes Last, at the wheel. Drawn up through the neck ropes, drawn out of his stomach by the spirit of the stones that line the road and speak to him only in their old agreement. Ira knows the old man is nuts. Lets him out at the road that leads up over stars and the skulls of white cranes. And through the soft explosions of cattail and the scattering of seeds on still water, walks Grandpa, all the time that there is in his hands that have grown to be the twisted doubles of the burrows of mole and badger, that have come to be the absence of birds in a nest.

To be human is to have a sense of being within self. Sun. Red. Trees. Our hearts’ eyes seeing inward and outward, accepting: Stand and be humble. The more names you have the more of a person you become. That’s what I’ve heard. I was telling Tom yesterday afternoon. Values, education, social change, cultural corruption, what is and what isn’t. I have to dispute him at moments. I tell him, The knowledge we derive from the education we get is our own. Knowledge is determined by our cultural, spiritual, linguistic, political environment. The knowledge from the community and context here cannot be anything but the people’s own. This is not Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, or Rapid City. This is Rosebud, the Lakota homeland.

Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food. The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferably from a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory. If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slender and in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian man then he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture. If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so white that we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers. When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gasps at the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature: brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water. If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret. Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed. Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm. Indian men, of course, are storms. They should destroy the lives of any white women who choose to love them. All white women love Indian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgust at the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him. White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures. Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian man unbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil. There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape. Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds. Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visions if they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indian then the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carry an Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breed and obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man. If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is inside a white woman. Sometimes there are complications. An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian woman can be hidden inside a white man. In these rare instances, everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture. There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven. For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gender not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.

I don’t know what to do. Suddenly, I hear a voice. “Excuse me,” it says. I look up and see a little girl standing in front of me. “I found your keys,” she says. I take the keys from her and smile. “Thank you,” I say. “You’re welcome,” she says. And then she runs away. I watch her go, and I feel a sense of relief. My keys are safe, and I can go home. I stand up and start to walk away, but then I stop. I turn around and look at the place where I lost my keys. It’s just a patch of grass, but it’s also the place where I found them.

I think it was when I was a child. I remember being in elementary school, and I would always be biting my nails. My teachers would always tell me to stop, but I couldn't help myself. It was like an addiction. I would bite my nails until they were bleeding, and then I would start all over again. I tried to stop biting my nails, but I couldn't do it. I was too addicted.

At the gates we are given new papers, our old clothes are taken and we are given overalls like mechanics wear. We are given shots and doctors ask questions. Then we gather in another room where counselors orient us to the new land we will now live in. We take tests. Some of us were craftsmen in the old world, good with our hands and proud of our work. Others were good with their heads. They used common sense like scholars use glasses and books to reach the world. But most of us didn’t finish high school. The old men who have lived here stare at us, from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated. We pass them as they stand around idle, leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls. Our expectations are high: in the old world, they talked about rehabilitation, about being able to finish school, and learning an extra good trade. But right away we are sent to work as dishwashers, to work in fields for three cents an hour. The administration says this is temporary So we go about our business, blacks with blacks, poor whites with poor whites, chicanos and indians by themselves. The administration says this is right, no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart, like in the old neighborhoods we came from. We came here to get away from false promises, from dictators in our neighborhoods, who wore blue suits and broke our doors down when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like, swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased. But it’s no different here. It’s all concentrated. The doctors don’t care, our bodies decay, our minds deteriorate, we learn nothing of value. Our lives don’t get better, we go down quick. My cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines, my T-shirts, boxer shorts, socks and pants are drying. Just like it used to be in my neighborhood: from all the tenements laundry hung window to window. Across the way Joey is sticking his hands through the bars to hand Felipé a cigarette, men are hollering back and forth cell to cell, saying their sinks don’t work, or somebody downstairs hollers angrily about a toilet overflowing, or that the heaters don’t work. I ask Coyote next door to shoot me over a little more soap to finish my laundry. I look down and see new immigrants coming in, mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders, new haircuts and brogan boots, looking around, each with a dream in their heart, thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives. But in the end, some will just sit around talking about how good the old world was. Some of the younger ones will become gangsters. Some will die and others will go on living without a soul, a future, or a reason to live. Some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes, but so very few make it out of here as human as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now as they look at their hands so long away from their tools, as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families, so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49558/immigrants-in-our-own-land,,3032,"We are born with dreams in our hearts, Looking for better days ahead.

The question of the right of the people to bear arms is one of the most important that can be presented to the American people. It is a question that has been debated for over two hundred years, and it is a question that is still being debated today. There are many different opinions on this issue, and there are many different arguments that can be made on both sides of the issue. However, one thing is for sure: the way in which the question is put can have a significant impact on the outcome of the debate. One way to put the question of the right to bear arms is to ask whether or not the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns. This is the way that the question is typically put by gun rights advocates. They argue that the Second Amendment was intended to protect the individual right of citizens to own guns for self-defense, hunting, and other lawful purposes. Gun control advocates, on the other hand, typically argue that the Second Amendment does not guarantee an individual right to own guns. They argue that the Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of states to maintain militias, and that it does not give individuals the right to own guns for personal use. Another way to put the question of the right to bear arms is to ask whether or not the government should regulate the ownership of guns. This is the way that the question is typically put by gun control advocates. They argue that the government has a responsibility to regulate the ownership of guns in order to reduce gun violence. Gun rights advocates, on the other hand, typically argue that the government should not regulate the ownership of guns. They argue that the government should not interfere with the rights of citizens to own guns. The way in which the question of the right to bear arms is put can have a significant impact on the outcome of the debate. If the question is put in terms of whether or not the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns, then the debate is likely to focus on the interpretation of the Second Amendment. If the question is put in terms of whether or not the government should regulate the ownership of guns, then the debate is likely to focus on the costs and benefits of gun control. Ultimately, the question of the right to bear arms is a complex one with no easy answers. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides of the issue. However, the way in which the question is put can have a significant impact on the outcome of the debate.",2468,1,1,0,2,TRUE

Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed, surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of machinery.

The grime was no man’s grime but death and human locomotives, all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black mis’ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt—industrial—modern—all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown— and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what more could I name, the smoked ashes of some cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs & sphincters of dynamos—all these entangled in your mummied roots—and you there standing before me in the sunset, all your glory in your form!

The uncles fell in, chuckling phony chuckles, What a good time she’ll have learning to swim! Back in my sisters’ room Mami was packing a hurried bag, allowing one toy apiece, her red eyes belying her explanation: a week at the beach so Papi can get some rest. She dressed us in our best dresses, party shoes. Something was off, I knew, but I was young and didn’t think adult things could go wrong. So as we quietly filed out of the house we wouldn’t see again for another decade, I let myself lie back in the deep waters, my arms out like Jesus’ on His cross, and instead of sinking down as I’d always done, magically, that night, I could stay up, floating out, past the driveway, past the gates, in the black Ford, Papi grim at the wheel, winding through back roads, stroke by difficult stroke, out on the highway, heading toward the coast. Past the checkpoint, we raced towards the airport, my sisters crying when we turned before the family beach house, Mami consoling, there was a better surprise in store for us! She couldn’t tell, though, until ... until we were there. But I had already swum ahead and guessed some loss much larger than I understood, more danger than the deep end of the pool. At the dark, deserted airport we waited. All night in a fitful sleep, I swam. At dawn the plane arrived, and as we boarded, Papi, you turned, your eyes scanned the horizon as if you were trying to sight a distant swimmer, your hand frantically waving her back in, for you knew as we stepped inside the cabin that a part of both of us had been set adrift. Weeks later, wandering our new city, hand in hand, you tried to explain the wonders: escalators as moving belts; elevators: pulleys and ropes; blond hair and blue eyes: a genetic code. We stopped before a summery display window at Macy’s, The World’s Largest Department Store, to admire a family outfitted for the beach: the handsome father, slim and sure of himself, so unlike you, Papi, with your thick mustache, your three-piece suit, your fedora hat, your accent. And by his side a girl who looked like Heidi in my storybook waded in colored plastic. We stood awhile, marveling at America, both of us trying hard to feel luckier than we felt, both of us pointing out the beach pails, the shovels, the sandcastles no wave would ever topple, the red and blue boats. And when we backed away, we saw our reflections superimposed, big-eyed, dressed too formally with all due respect as visitors to this country.

Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question ... Oh, do not ask, “What is it?” Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes, Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes; There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate; Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. And indeed there will be time To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?” Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair — (They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”) My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin — (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”) Do I dare Disturb the universe? In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. For I have known them all already, known them all: Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, I have measured out my life with coffee spoons; I know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther room. So how should I presume? And I have known the eyes already, known them all— The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, Then how should I begin To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? And how should I presume? And I have known the arms already, known them all— Arms that are braceleted and white and bare (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!) Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress? Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. And should I then presume? And how should I begin? Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ... I should have been a pair of ragged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas. And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, I am no prophet — and here’s no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid. And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it towards some overwhelming question, To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”— If one, settling a pillow by her head Should say: “That is not what I meant at all; That is not it, at all.” And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor— And this, and so much more?— It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: “That is not it at all, That is not what I meant, at all.” No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous— Almost, at times, the Fool.

After the initial presidential election results come in, I stop watching the news. I want to continue watching, charting, and discussing the counts, the recounts, the hand counts, but I can­not. I lose hope. However Bush came to have won, he would still be winning ten days later and we would still be in the throes of our American optimism. All the non-reporting is a distraction from Bush himself, the same Bush who can't remember if two or three people were convicted for dragging a black man to his death in his home state of Texas. / You don't remember because you don't care. Some­times my mother's voice swells and fills my forehead. Mostly I resist the flooding, but in Bush's case I find myself talking to the television screen: You don't know because you don't care. / Then, like all things impassioned, this voice takes on a life of its own: You don't know because you don't bloody care. Do you? / I forget things too. It makes me sad. Or it makes me the saddest. The sadness is not really about George W. or our American optimism; the sadness lives in the recog­nition that a life can not matter. Or, as there are billions of lives, my sadness is alive alongside the recognition that billions of lives never mattered. I write this with­out breaking my heart, without bursting into anything. Perhaps this is the real source of my sadness. Or, per­haps, Emily Dickinson, my love, hope was never a thing with feathers. I don't know, I just find when the news comes on I switch the channel. This new ten­dency might be indicative of a deepening personality flaw: IMH, The Inability to Maintain Hope, which trans­lates into no innate trust in the supreme laws that gov­ern us. Cornel West says this is what is wrong with black people today—too nihilistic. Too scarred by hope to hope, too experienced to experience, too close to dead is what I think.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57804/dont-let-me-be-lonely-cornel-west-makes-the-point,,1932,"Cornel West makes the point that hope is different from American optimism. Optimism is a belief that things will get better, even if there’s no evidence to support that belief. Hope is a practice, an act of faith in the face of uncertainty. It’s the belief that even if things don’t get better, we can still find meaning in the struggle. I think about this as I watch the news, as I see the world falling apart. It’s easy to despair, to give up hope. But then I remember what Cornel West says, that hope is a practice. It’s something we have to do, even when it’s hard. So I keep hoping, even though I know things are bad. I keep hoping, because I believe that we can make things better. I keep hoping, because I believe in the power of love. I keep hoping, because I believe in the power of change.",1418,"He argues that American optimism is a form of “false consciousness” that prevents people from seeing the real problems facing society. Hope, on the other hand, is a “realistic” understanding of the challenges that exist, but it also involves a commitment to working to overcome them. West’s distinction between optimism and hope is a useful one. Optimism can be a powerful force for good, but it can also be dangerous if it leads people to believe that problems will solve themselves without any effort on their part. Hope, on the other hand, is a more active and engaged approach to dealing with challenges. It involves a willingness to confront the problems that exist, but it also involves a belief that those problems can be overcome. West’s point about American optimism is particularly important in the current political climate. In the United States, there is a strong tendency to believe that the country is always on the right track and that things will only get better. This kind of optimism can be comforting, but it can also be dangerous if it leads people to ignore the real problems that exist. West argues that hope is a more realistic and productive approach to dealing with the challenges facing the United States. Hope involves a willingness to see the problems that exist, but it also involves a commitment to working to overcome them. This kind of hope is essential for creating a better future for the country. In his book “Race Matters,” West writes, “Hope is the feeling that what is important to us will happen even if it is not probable.” This definition of hope is consistent with his distinction between optimism and hope. Optimism is based on the belief that things will get better even if there is no evidence to support that belief. Hope, on the other hand, is based on the belief that things can get better even if it is not probable. This is a more realistic and achievable goal. West also argues that hope is essential for social change. He writes, “Hope is the only antidote to despair, the only energy source that can keep us going in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.” This is a powerful statement about the importance of hope. When we are faced with challenges, it is easy to give up. But hope gives us the strength to keep going, even when things are tough. West’s work on hope is an important contribution to the discussion about social change. He argues that hope is essential for creating a better future, and he provides a definition of hope that is both realistic and achievable. Hope is the feeling that what is important to us will happen even if it is not probable. This is a powerful force for good, and it is essential for creating a better future for the United States.",1941,0,0,0,0,FALSE

Once up against the sky it's hard to tell them from the stars— planets, that is—the tinted ones: Venus going down, or Mars, or the pale green one. With a wind, they flare and falter, wobble and toss; but if it's still they steer between the kite sticks of the Southern Cross, receding, dwindling, solemnly and steadily forsaking us, or, in the downdraft from a peak, suddenly turning dangerous. Last night another big one fell. It splattered like an egg of fire against the cliff behind the house. The flame ran down. We saw the pair of owls who nest there flying up and up, their whirling black-and-white stained bright pink underneath, until they shrieked up out of sight. The ancient owls' nest must have burned. Hastily, all alone, a glistening armadillo left the scene, rose-flecked, head down, tail down, and then a baby rabbit jumped out, short-eared, to our surprise.

20,Elizabeth Bishop,39203,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Woman,White,At the Fishhouses,"Although it is a cold evening, down by one of the fishhouses","Although it is a cold evening, down by one of the fishhouses an old man sits netting, his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, a dark purple-brown, and his shuttle worn and polished. The air smells so strong of codfish it makes one’s nose run and one’s eyes water. The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up to storerooms in the gables for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, is opaque, but the silver of the benches, the lobster pots, and masts, scattered among the wild jagged rocks, is of an apparent translucence like the small old buildings with an emerald moss growing on their shoreward walls. The big fish tubs are completely lined with layers of beautiful herring scales and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered with creamy iridescent coats of mail, with small iridescent flies crawling on them. Up on the little slope behind the houses, set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, is an ancient wooden capstan, cracked, with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, where the ironwork has rusted. The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. He was a friend of my grandfather. We talk of the decline in the population and of codfish and herring while he waits for a herring boat to come in. There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, the blade of which is almost worn away. Down at the water’s edge, at the place where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp descending into the water, thin silver tree trunks are laid horizontally across the gray stones, down and down at intervals of four or five feet. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, element bearable to no mortal, to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly I have seen here evening after evening. He was curious about me. He was interested in music; like me a believer in total immersion, so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. I also sang “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.” He stood up in the water and regarded me steadily, moving his head a little. Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug as if it were against his better judgment. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us, the dignified tall firs begin. Bluish, associating with their shadows, a million Christmas trees stand waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, icily free above the stones, above the stones and then the world. If you should dip your hand in, your wrist would ache immediately, your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn as if the water were a transmutation of fire that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, then briny, then surely burn your tongue. It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52192/at-the-fishhouses,"At the Fishhouses by Elizabeth Bishop Among the fishhouses, the old men sit on their haunches, talking of the sea.

So with my eyes I traced the line Of the horizon, thin and fine, Straight around till I was come Back to where I'd started from; And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood. Over these things I could not see; These were the things that bounded me; And I could touch them with my hand, Almost, I thought, from where I stand. And all at once things seemed so small My breath came short, and scarce at all. But, sure, the sky is big, I said; Miles and miles above my head; So here upon my back I'll lie And look my fill into the sky. And so I looked, and, after all, The sky was not so very tall. The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, And—sure enough!—I see the top! The sky, I thought, is not so grand; I 'most could touch it with my hand! And reaching up my hand to try, I screamed to feel it touch the sky. I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity Came down and settled over me; Forced back my scream into my chest, Bent back my arm upon my breast, And, pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind, Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold; Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around, And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres, The creaking of the tented sky, The ticking of Eternity. I saw and heard, and knew at last The How and Why of all things, past, And present, and forevermore. The Universe, cleft to the core, Lay open to my probing sense That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence But could not,—nay! But needs must suck At the great wound, and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn! For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul. All sin was of my sinning, all Atoning mine, and mine the gall Of all regret. Mine was the weight Of every brooded wrong, the hate That stood behind each envious thrust, Mine every greed, mine every lust. And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,— Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,—then mourned for all! A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat. No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God. Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die. Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,—there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust. Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead. And all at once, and over all The pitying rain began to fall; I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly, thatched roof, And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before. For rain it hath a friendly sound To one who's six feet underground; And scarce the friendly voice or face: A grave is such a quiet place. The rain, I said, is kind to come And speak to me in my new home. I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain, To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line, To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping apple-trees. For soon the shower will be done, And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously, and each round drop Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top. How can I bear it; buried here, While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm? O, multi-colored, multiform, Beloved beauty over me, That I shall never, never see Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, That I shall never more behold! Sleeping your myriad magics through, Close-sepulchred away from you! O God, I cried, give me new birth, And put me back upon the earth! Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain, down-poured In one big torrent, set me free, Washing my grave away from me! I ceased; and through the breathless hush That answered me, the far-off rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer, and—crash! Before the wild wind's whistling lash The startled storm-clouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky, And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave. I know not how such things can be; I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things; A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself, And, through and over everything, A sense of glad awakening. The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, Whispering to me I could hear; I felt the rain's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips, Laid gently on my sealed sight, And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see,— A drenched and dripping apple-tree, A last long line of silver rain, A sky grown clear and blue again. And as I looked a quickening gust Of wind blew up to me and thrust Into my face a miracle Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,— I know not how such things can be!— I breathed my soul back into me. Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I And hailed the earth with such a cry As is not heard save from a man Who has been dead, and lives again. About the trees my arms I wound; Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; I raised my quivering arms on high; I laughed and laughed into the sky, Till at my throat a strangling sob Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb Sent instant tears into my eyes; O God, I cried, no dark disguise Can e'er hereafter hide from me Thy radiant identity! Thou canst not move across the grass But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, Nor speak, however silently, But my hushed voice will answer Thee. I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day; God, I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart! The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide; Above the world is stretched the sky,— No higher than the soul is high. The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand; The soul can split the sky in two, And let the face of God shine through. But East and West will pinch the heart That can not keep them pushed apart; And he whose soul is flat—the sky Will cave in on him by and by.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55993/renascence,"**Renascence** BY EDNA ST.

This is due to a number of factors, including: * **Life changes:** As we get older, our lives change in many ways. We may move to a new city, start a new job, or have children. These changes can make it difficult to stay in touch with our friends from the past. * **Death:** As we get older, we are more likely to experience the death of our friends and loved ones. This can be a devastating loss, and it can take time to heal from. * **Health problems:** As we get older, we are more likely to develop health problems that can make it difficult to socialize. For example, we may have difficulty getting around, or we may be in pain. This can make it difficult to stay in touch with our friends and make new ones. It's important to remember that losing friends is a normal part of aging. It doesn't mean that we're any less loved or valuable. It simply means that our lives are changing, and we need to adjust accordingly. Here are some tips for coping with the loss of friends: * **Grieve:** It's important to allow yourself to grieve the loss of a friend. This may involve crying, talking about your feelings, or writing in a journal. * **Reach out to other friends:** Don't isolate yourself. Make an effort to stay in touch with your other friends and make new ones. * **Be kind to yourself:** It's okay to feel sad or lonely after losing a friend. Just remember that you're not alone, and that things will get better with time. Losing friends is never easy, but it's important to remember that we're not alone. With time and effort, we can learn to cope with the loss and move on with our lives.",3144,0,0,0,0,FALSE

This rivalry led to a number of proxy wars and other conflicts, and it also increased the risk of nuclear war. The end of the Cold War in 1991 removed this major source of conflict and instability. * **The rise of global institutions:** A number of international institutions have been established since the end of the Second World War. These institutions, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, have helped to promote cooperation and resolve conflicts between countries. * **Increased economic interdependence:** The world has become increasingly interdependent economically in recent decades. This interdependence has made it more difficult for countries to go to war with each other, as they would risk damaging their own economies. * **The spread of democracy:** There has been a global trend towards democracy in recent decades. This trend has helped to promote peace, as democracies are less likely to go to war with each other than authoritarian regimes. Of course, the world is not completely at peace. There are still conflicts and tensions in many parts of the world.

One day, Anya was walking in the forest when she came across a group of peasants. They were poor and dirty, but they were also happy. They laughed and sang as they worked in the fields, and they seemed to have no cares in the world. Anya was envious of their simple life. Anya decided to leave the castle and live among the peasants. She disguised herself as a peasant girl and went to work in the fields. At first, the peasants were suspicious of her, but they soon warmed up to her. They taught her how to work the land and how to live off the land. Anya learned to appreciate the simple things in life, and she finally found happiness. One day, Anya's brother, the king, came to visit the village. He was surprised to see Anya working in the fields, but he was even more surprised when she bowed to him.

But the doctors return to scold me. I speak. It is you my silence harms. I should have known; I should have told them something to write down. My voice alarms my throat. “Name of father—none.” I hold you and name you bastard in my arms. And now that’s that. There is nothing more that I can say or lose. Others have traded life before and could not speak. I tighten to refuse your owling eyes, my fragile visitor. I touch your cheeks, like flowers. You bruise against me. We unlearn.

Others are escapees from the night shift, sip lukewarm coffee, shift gears to the other side of darkness.

I own indeed, that generous mind That weeps the woes of human kind, That heart by friendship's charms inspired, That soul with sprightly fancy fired, The air of life, the vivid eye, The flowing wit, the keen reply— To paint these beauties as they shine, Might ask a nobler pen than mine. Yet what sure strokes can draw the Fair, Who vary, like the fleeting air, Like willows bending to the force, Where'er the gales direct their course, Opposed to no misfortune's power, And changing with the changing hour. Now gaily sporting on the plain, They charm the grove with pleasing strain; Anon disturb'd, they know not why, The sad tear trembles in their eye: Led through vain life's uncertain dance, The dupes of whim, the slaves of chance. From me, not famed for much goodnature, Expect not compliment, but satire; To draw your picture quite unable, Instead of fact accept a Fable. One morn, in Æsop's noisy time, When all things talk'd, and talk'd in rhyme, A cloud exhaled by vernal beams Rose curling o'er the glassy streams. The dawn her orient blushes spread, And tinged its lucid skirts with red, Wide waved its folds with glitt'ring dies, And gaily streak'd the eastern skies; Beneath, illumed with rising day, The sea's broad mirror floating lay. Pleased, o'er the wave it hung in air, Survey'd its glittering glories there, And fancied, dress'd in gorgeous show, Itself the brightest thing below: For clouds could raise the vaunting strain, And not the fair alone were vain. Yet well it knew, howe'er array'd, That beauty, e'en in clouds, might fade, That nothing sure its charms could boast Above the loveliest earthly toast; And so, like them, in early dawn Resolved its picture should be drawn, That when old age with length'ning day Should brush the vivid rose away, The world should from the portrait own Beyond all clouds how bright it shone. Hard by, a painter raised his stage, Far famed, the Copley[1] of his age. So just a form his colours drew, Each eye the perfect semblance knew; Yet still on every blooming face He pour'd the pencil's flowing grace; Each critic praised the artist rare, Who drew so like, and yet so fair. To him, high floating in the sky Th' elated Cloud advanced t' apply. The painter soon his colours brought, The Cloud then sat, the artist wrought; Survey'd her form, with flatt'ring strictures, Just as when ladies sit for pictures, Declared ""whatever art can do, My utmost skill shall try for you: But sure those strong and golden dies Dipp'd in the radiance of the skies, Those folds of gay celestial dress, No mortal colours can express. Not spread triumphal o'er the plain, The rainbow boasts so fair a train, Nor e'en the morning sun so bright, Who robes his face in heav'nly light. To view that form of angel make, Again Ixion would mistake, And justly deem so fair a prize, The sovereign Mistress of the skies,"" He said, and drew a mazy line, With crimson touch his pencils shine, The mingling colours sweetly fade, And justly temper light and shade. He look'd; the swelling Cloud on high With wider circuit spread the sky, Stretch'd to the sun an ampler train, And pour'd new glories on the main. As quick, effacing every ground, His pencil swept the canvas round, And o'er its field, with magic art, Call'd forth new forms in every part. But now the sun, with rising ray, Advanced with speed his early way; Each colour takes a differing die, The orange glows, the purples fly. The artist views the alter'd sight, And varies with the varying light; In vain! a sudden gust arose, New folds ascend, new shades disclose, And sailing on with swifter pace, The Cloud displays another face. In vain the painter, vex'd at heart, Tried all the wonders of his art; In vain he begg'd, her form to grace, One moment she would keep her place: For, ""changing thus with every gale, Now gay with light, with gloom now pale, Now high in air with gorgeous train, Now settling on the darken'd main, With looks more various than the moon; A French coquette were drawn as soon."" He spoke; again the air was mild, The Cloud with opening radiance smiled; With canvas new his art he tries, Anew he joins the glitt'ring dies; Th' admiring Cloud with pride beheld Her image deck the pictured field, And colours half-complete adorn The splendor of the painted morn. When lo, the stormy winds arise, Deep gloom invests the changing skies; The sounding tempest shakes the plain, And lifts in billowy surge the main.

Each stock or stone could prate and gabble, Worse than ten labourers of Babel. Along the street, perhaps you'd see A Post disputing with a Tree, And mid their arguments of weight, A Goose sit umpire of debate. Each Dog you met, though speechless now, Would make his compliments and bow, And every Swine with congees come, To know how did all friends at home. Each Block sublime could make a speech, In style and eloquence as rich, And could pronounce it and could pen it, As well as Chatham in the senate. Nor prose alone.—In these young times, Each field was fruitful too in rhymes; Each feather'd minstrel felt the passion, And every wind breathed inspiration. Each Bullfrog croak'd in loud bombastic, Each Monkey chatter'd Hudibrastic; Each Cur, endued with yelping nature, Could outbark Churchill's self in satire; Each Crow in prophecy delighted, Each Owl, you saw, was second-sighted, Each Goose a skilful politician, Each Ass a gifted met'physician, Could preach in wrath 'gainst laughing rogues, Write Halfway-covenant Dialogues, And wisely judge of all disputes In commonwealths of men or brutes. 'Twas then, in spring a youthful Sparrow Felt the keen force of Cupid's arrow: For Birds, as Æsop's tales avow, Made love then, just as men do now, And talk'd of deaths and flames and darts, And breaking necks and losing hearts; And chose from all th' aerial kind, Not then to tribes, like Jews, confined The story tells, a lovely Thrush Had smit him from a neigh'bring bush, Where oft the young coquette would play, And carol sweet her siren lay: She thrill'd each feather'd heart with love, And reign'd the Toast of all the grove. He felt the pain, but did not dare Disclose his passion to the fair; For much he fear'd her conscious pride Of race, to noble blood allied. Her grandsire's nest conspicuous stood, Mid loftiest branches of the wood, In airy height, that scorn'd to know Each flitting wing that waved below. So doubting, on a point so nice He deem'd it best to take advice. Hard by there dwelt an aged Owl, Of all his friends the gravest fowl; Who from the cares of business free, Lived, hermit, in a hollow tree; To solid learning bent his mind, In trope and syllogism he shined, 'Gainst reigning follies spent his railing; Too much a Stoic—'twas his failing. Hither for aid our Sparrow came, And told his errand and his name, With panting breath explain'd his case, Much trembling at the sage's face; And begg'd his Owlship would declare If love were worth a wise one's care. The grave Owl heard the weighty cause, And humm'd and hah'd at every pause; Then fix'd his looks in sapient plan, Stretch'd forth one foot, and thus began. ""My son, my son, of love beware, And shun the cheat of beauty's snare; That snare more dreadful to be in, Than huntsman's net, or horse-hair gin. ""By others' harms learn to be wise,"" As ancient proverbs well advise. Each villany, that nature breeds, From females and from love proceeds. 'Tis love disturbs with fell debate Of man and beast the peaceful state: Men fill the world with war's alarms, When female trumpets sound to arms; The commonwealth of dogs delight For beauties, as for bones, to fight. Love hath his tens of thousands slain, And heap'd with copious death the plain: Samson, with ass's jaw to aid, Ne'er peopled thus th'infernal shade. ""Nor this the worst; for he that's dead, With love no more will vex his head. 'Tis in the rolls of fate above, That death's a certain cure for love; A noose can end the cruel smart; The lover's leap is from a cart. But oft a living death they bear, Scorn'd by the proud, capricious fair. The fair to sense pay no regard, And beauty is the fop's reward; They slight the generous hearts' esteem, And sigh for those, who fly from them. Just when your wishes would prevail, Some rival bird with gayer tail, Who sings his strain with sprightlier note, And chatters praise with livelier throat, Shall charm your flutt'ring fair one down, And leave your choice, to hang or drown. Ev'n I, my son, have felt the smart; A Pheasant won my youthful heart. For her I tuned the doleful lay, For her I watch'd the night away; In vain I told my piteous case, And smooth'd my dignity of face; In vain I cull'd the studied phrase, And sought hard words in beauty's praise. Her, not my charms nor sense could move, For folly is the food of love. Each female scorns our serious make, ""Each woman is at heart a rake.""

He said to his friend, “If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night, Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,— One if by land, and two if by sea; And I on the opposite shore will be, Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm, For the country-folk to be up and to arm.” Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore, Just as the moon rose over the bay, Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset, British man-of-war: A phantom ship, with each mast and spar Across the moon, like a prison-bar, And a huge black hulk, that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide. Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street Wanders and watches with eager ears, Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door, The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, And the measured tread of the grenadiers Marching down to their boats on the shore. Then he climbed to the tower of the church, Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread, To the belfry-chamber overhead, And startled the pigeons from their perch On the sombre rafters, that round him made Masses and moving shapes of shade,— By the trembling ladder, steep and tall, To the highest window in the wall, Where he paused to listen and look down A moment on the roofs of the town, And the moonlight flowing over all. Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, In their night-encampment on the hill, Wrapped in silence so deep and still That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread, The watchful night-wind, as it went Creeping along from tent to tent, And seeming to whisper, “All is well!” A moment only he feels the spell Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread Of the lonely belfry and the dead; For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away, Where the river widens to meet the bay,— A line of black, that bends and floats On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. Now he patted his horse’s side, Now gazed on the landscape far and near, Then impetuous stamped the earth, And turned and tightened his saddle-girth; But mostly he watched with eager search The belfry-tower of the old North Church, As it rose above the graves on the hill, Lonely and spectral and sombre and still. And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height, A glimmer, and then a gleam of light! He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight A second lamp in the belfry burns! A hurry of hoofs in a village-street, A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet: That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light, The fate of a nation was riding that night; And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, Kindled the land into flame with its heat. He has left the village and mounted the steep, And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep, Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides; And under the alders, that skirt its edge, Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge, Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides. It was twelve by the village clock When he crossed the bridge into Medford town. He heard the crowing of the cock, And the barking of the farmer’s dog, And felt the damp of the river-fog, That rises when the sun goes down. It was one by the village clock, When he galloped into Lexington. He saw the gilded weathercock Swim in the moonlight as he passed, And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, Gaze at him with a spectral glare, As if they already stood aghast At the bloody work they would look upon. It was two by the village clock, When he came to the bridge in Concord town. He heard the bleating of the flock, And the twitter of birds among the trees, And felt the breath of the morning breeze Blowing over the meadows brown. And one was safe and asleep in his bed Who at the bridge would be first to fall, Who that day would be lying dead, Pierced by a British musket-ball. You know the rest. In the books you have read, How the British Regulars fired and fled,— How the farmers gave them ball for ball, From behind each fence and farmyard-wall, Chasing the red-coats down the lane, Then crossing the fields to emerge again Under the trees at the turn of the road, And only pausing to fire and load. So through the night rode Paul Revere; And so through the night went his cry of alarm To every Middlesex village and farm,— A cry of defiance, and not of fear, A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door, And a word that shall echo forevermore! For, borne on the night-wind of the Past, Through all our history, to the last, In the hour of darkness and peril and need, The people will waken and listen to hear The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed, And the midnight message of Paul Revere.",https://poets.org/poem/paul-reveres-ride,,5208,"Listen, my children, and you shall hear Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five; Hardly a man is now alive Who remembers that famous day and year.

Then he said, ""Good night! And have a pleasant ride!"" And with a smile turned his horse's head, And away he went like a flash of light, Into the darkness of the night. And all along the shore, dimly seen, The flickering of lights from many a steeple, The village bells rang out in alarm, And the people came pouring out of their homes, By thousands and by tens of thousands, Armed with muskets and with pikes, Ready to fight for their homes and their rights, For their wives and their children, For the freedom of their native land. And so through the night rode Paul Revere; And so through the night went his cry of alarm To every Middlesex village and farm, A cry of defiance and of hope; A cry that echoed through the valleys and the hills, Through the forests and the fields, Echoed and re-echoed, Until the whole country heard the sound, And the people rose in arms to fight for their freedom.

Revere rode on and on, Never stopping until he reached Lexington. He met the American Minutemen there, And he told them that the British were coming. The Minutemen were ready for the British. They lined up on the village green, And they waited for the British to attack. The British came, And the Minutemen fought them bravely. The British were defeated, And they retreated back to Boston. The American Revolution had begun, And Paul Revere had played a key role in it. He had warned the Minutemen, And he had helped them to win the battle.

Who straightway peeped out of the shell To view the world beyond, Longing at once to sally forth And paddle in the pond. ""Oh! be not rash,"" her father said, A mild Socratic bird; Her mother begged her not to stray With many a warning word. But little goosey was perverse, And eagerly did cry, ""I've got a lovely pair of wings, Of course I ought to fly."" In vain parental cacklings, In vain the cold sky's frown, Ambitious goosey tried to soar, But always tumbled down. The farmyard jeered at her attempts, The peacocks screamed, ""Oh fie! You're only a domestic goose, So don't pretend to fly."" Great cock-a-doodle from his perch Crowed daily loud and clear, ""Stay in the puddle, foolish bird, That is your proper sphere,"" The ducks and hens said, one and all, In gossip by the pool, ""Our children never play such pranks; My dear, that fowl's a fool."" The owls came out and flew about, Hooting above the rest, ""No useful egg was ever hatched From transcendental nest."" Good little goslings at their play And well-conducted chicks Were taught to think poor goosey's flights Were naughty, ill-bred tricks. They were content to swim and scratch, And not at all inclined For any wild goose chase in search Of something undefined. Hard times she had as one may guess, That young aspiring bird, Who still from every fall arose Saddened but undeterred. She knew she was no nightingale Yet spite of much abuse, She longed to help and cheer the world, Although a plain gray goose She could not sing, she could not fly, Nor even walk, with grace, And all the farmyard had declared A puddle was her place. But something stronger than herself Would cry, ""Go on, go on! Remember, though an humble fowl, You're cousin to a swan."" So up and down poor goosey went, A busy, hopeful bird. Searched many wide unfruitful fields, And many waters stirred. At length she came unto a stream Most fertile of all Niles, Where tuneful birds might soar and sing Among the leafy isles. Here did she build a little nest Beside the waters still, Where the parental goose could rest Unvexed by any bill. And here she paused to smooth her plumes, Ruffled by many plagues; When suddenly arose the cry, ""This goose lays golden eggs."" At once the farmyard was agog; The ducks began to quack; Prim Guinea fowls relenting called, ""Come back, come back, come back."" Great chanticleer was pleased to give A patronizing crow, And the contemptuous biddies clucked, ""I wish my chicks did so."" The peacocks spread their shining tails, And cried in accents soft, ""We want to know you, gifted one, Come up and sit aloft."" Wise owls awoke and gravely said, With proudly swelling breasts, ""Rare birds have always been evoked From transcendental nests!"" News-hunting turkeys from afar Now ran with all thin legs To gobble facts and fictions of The goose with golden eggs. But best of all the little fowls Still playing on the shore, Soft downy chicks and goslings gay, Chirped out, ""Dear Goose, lay more."" But goosey all these weary years Had toiled like any ant, And wearied out she now replied ""My little dears, I can't. ""When I was starving, half this corn Had been of vital use, Now I am surfeited with food Like any Strasbourg goose."" So to escape too many friends, Without uncivil strife, She ran to the Atlantic pond And paddled for her life. Soon up among the grand old Alps She found two blessed things, The health she had so nearly lost, And rest for weary limbs. But still across the briny deep Couched in most friendly words, Came prayers for letters, tales, or verse From literary birds. Whereat the renovated fowl With grateful thanks profuse, Took from her wing a quill and wrote This lay of a Golden Goose.",https://mypoeticside.com/show-classic-poem-586,,3777,"Long ago in a poultry yard One dull November morn, A speckled hen sat on her nest, And hatched out five small chicks.

One day, the little chicks were playing In the yard when they saw a big, black cat. The cat was coming towards them, And the little chicks were scared. But the mother hen was brave. She stood up to the cat and said, ""Go away! You can't have my chicks!"" The cat was scared of the mother hen, And it ran away. The little chicks were safe, And they were very grateful to their mother hen. The little chicks grew up to be big, strong chickens. They all had families of their own, And they all remembered the love and care That their mother hen had given them. The end.",3131,"A hen was found with a broken wing, And her feathers all were torn. She sat upon a rock and cried, ""Oh, what shall I do? I cannot fly, and I cannot lay, And my little chicks will starve for food."" Just then a wise old owl flew down, And perched upon a tree. ""Why do you cry, my little hen?"" He asked in a kindly voice. ""I have a broken wing,"" she said, ""And I cannot fly to find food for my little chicks."" ""Do not despair,"" said the owl. ""I will help you."" And so the owl flew away, And soon he returned with a mouse in his beak. ""Here is some food for your chicks,"" he said. ""And I will bring you more each day, Until your wing is healed."" The hen was so grateful, And she thanked the owl for his help. And so, each day the owl brought food to the hen, And her wing slowly healed. And soon she was able to fly again, And she was so happy to be able to care for her little chicks. The hen never forgot the kindness of the owl, And she was always grateful for his help.",3086,0,0,0,0,FALSE

You fear, because the southern climes pour'd forth Their clustering nations to infest the north, Barvarians, Austrians, those who Drink the Po And those who skirt the Tuscan seas below, With all Germania, Neustria, Belgia, Gaul, Doom'd here to wade thro slaughter to their fall, You fear he left behind no wars, to feed His feather'd canibals and nurse the breed. Fear not, my screamer, call your greedy train, Sweep over Europe, hurry back to Spain, You'll find his legions there; the valliant crew Please best their master when they toil for you. Abundant there they spread the country o'er And taint the breeze with every nation's gore, Iberian, Lussian, British widely strown, But still more wide and copious flows their own. Go where you will; Calabria, Malta, Greece, Egypt and Syria still his fame increase, Domingo's fatten'd isle and India's plains Glow deep with purple drawn from Gallic veins. No Raven's wing can stretch the flight so far As the torn bandrols of Napoleon's war. Choose then your climate, fix your best abode, He'll make you deserts and he'll bring you blood. How could you fear a dearth? have not mankind, Tho slain by millions, millions left behind? Has not CONSCRIPTION still the power to weild Her annual faulchion o'er the human field? A faithful harvester! or if a man Escape that gleaner, shall he scape the BAN? The triple BAN, that like the hound of hell Gripes with three joles, to hold his victim well. Fear nothing then, hatch fast your ravenous brood, Teach them to cry to Bonaparte for food; They'll be like you, of all his suppliant train, The only class that never cries in vain. For see what mutual benefits you lend! (The surest way to fix the mutual friend) While on his slaughter'd troops your tribes are fed, You cleanse his camp and carry off his dead. Imperial Scavenger! but now you know Your work is vain amid these hills of snow. His tentless troops are marbled thro with frost And change to crystal when the breath is lost. Mere trunks of ice, tho limb'd like human frames And lately warm'd with life's endearing flames, They cannot taint the air, the world impest, Nor can you tear one fiber from their breast. No! from their visual sockets, as they lie, With beak and claws you cannot pluck an eye. The frozen orb, preserving still its form, Defies your talons as it braves the storm, But stands and stares to God, as if to know In what curst hands he leaves his world below. Fly then, or starve; tho all the dreadful road From Minsk to Moskow with their bodies strow'd May count some Myriads, yet they can't suffice To feed you more beneath these dreary skies. Go back, and winter in the wilds of Spain; Feast there awhile, and in the next campaign Rejoin your master; for you'll find him then, With his new million of the race of men, Clothed in his thunders, all his flags unfurl'd, Raging and storming o'er the prostrate world. War after war his hungry soul requires, State after State shall sink beneath his fires, Yet other Spains in victim smoke shall rise And other Moskows suffocate the skies, Each land lie reeking with its people's slain And not a stream run bloodless to the main. Till men resume their souls, and dare to shed Earth's total vengeance on the monster's head, Hurl from his blood-built throne this king of woes, Dash him to dust, and let the world repose.",https://allpoetry.com/Advice-To-A-Raven-In-Russia-(1812),"Advice to a Raven in Russia Joel Barlow O Raven! while on Moscow's towers you sit, And croak amid the gloom of wintry night, Think on the fate of empires, and the pride Of those who now in pomp and splendor ride. The Czar, who rules the realms of vast extent, From the Baltic to the Eastern main, Whose armies shake the world, whose mandates awe The nations, and whose name is known to all; He too shall pass away, his power shall cease, And his proud race be mingled with the dust; His palaces shall fall, his sceptre rust, And his dominions be a desert waste. The nations that he conquers shall be free, And from his ashes shall new empires rise; The seeds of liberty shall spring and grow, And flourish, till his name be heard no more. O Raven! as you fly through the wide air, And see the earth beneath you spread like a map, Reflect on all the changes that have been, And all the revolutions of the past. The empires of the world have risen and fallen, And their great cities have been overthrown; The mighty kings who ruled them have passed away, And their names are now forgotten and unknown. But the cause of freedom still survives, And it shall never be extinguished till the end of time. It shall spread from land to land, and from sea to sea, Till all the nations of the earth are free.

Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of","A POEM IN THREE CANTOS Written at Chambery, in Savoy, January 1793 Omni tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci He makes a good breakfast who mixes pudding with molasses. Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of individuals or the prosperity of a nation, is of more consequence than we are apt to imagine. In recommending so important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wish it were in my power to do it in such a manner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am sensible that it is one of those subjects in which example has infinitely more power than the most convincing arguments or the highest charms of poetry. Goldsmith's Deserted Village, though possessing these two advantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being deserted. The apparent interest of the rich individuals, who form the taste as well as the laws in that country, has been against him; and with that interest it has been vain to contend. The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavor to combat, seem to me not so difficult to cure. No class of people has any interest in supporting them; unless it be the interest which certain families may feel in vying with each other in sumptuous entertainments. There may indeed be some instances of depraved appetites, which no arguments will conquer; but these must be rare. There are very few persons but what would always prefer a plain dish for themselves, and would prefer it likewise for their quests, if there were no risk of reputation in this case. This difficulty can only be removed by example; and the example should proceed from those whose situation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Persons of this description in America, I should hope, are neither above nor below the influence of truth and reason, when conveyed in language suited to the subject. Whether the manner I have chosen to address my arguments to them be such as to promise any success is what I cannot decide. But I certainly had hopes of doing some good, or I should not have taken the pains of putting so many rimes together. The example of domestic virtues has doubtless a great effect. I only wish to rank simplicity of diet among the virtues. In that case I should hope it will be cherished and more esteemed by others than it is at present. THE AUTHOR Canto I Ye Alps audacious, through the heavens that rise, To cramp the day and hide me from the skies; Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurled, Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world, I sing not to you. A softer theme I choose, A virgin theme, unconscious of the muse, But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire The purest frenzy of poetic fire. Despise it not, ye bards to terror steeled, Who hurl your thunders round the epic field; Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing Joys that the vineyard and the stillhouse bring; Or on some distant fair your notes employ, And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy. I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel, My morning incense, and my evening meal, The sweets of Hasty Pudding. Come, dear bowl, Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul. The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine, It's substance mingled, married in with thine, Shall cool and temper thy superior heat, And save the pains of blowing while I eat. Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue, Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime, And, as they roll in substance, roll in rime, No more thy awkward unpoetic name Should shun the muse, or prejudice thy fame; But rising grateful to the accustomed ear, All bards should catch it, and all realms revere! Assist me first with pious toil to trace Through wrecks of time thy lineage and they race; Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore, (Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore) First gave thee to the world; her works of fame Have lived indeed, but lived without a name. Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days, First learned with stones to crack the well-dried maize, Through the rough sieve to shake the golden shower, In boiling water stir the yellow flour: The yellow flour, bestrewed and stirred with haste, Swell in the flood and thickens to a paste, Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim, Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim; The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks, And the whole mass its true consistence takes. Could but her sacred name, unknown so long, Rise, like her labors, to the son of song, To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays, And blow her pudding with the breath of praise. If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before, I here ascribe her one great virtue more. Not through the rich Peruvian realms alone The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known, But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure, Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure. Dear Hasty Pudding, what unpromised joy Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy! Doomed o'er the world through devious paths to roam, Each clime my country, and each house my home, My soul is soothed, my cares have found an end, I greet my long-lost, unforgotten friend. For thee through Paris, that corrupted town, How long in vain I wandered up and down, Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard, Cold from his cave usurps the morning board. London is lost in smoke and steeped in tea; No Yankee there can lisp the name of thee; The uncouth word, a libel on the town, Would call a proclamation from the crown. For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays, Chilled in their fogs, exclude the generous maize; A grain whose rich luxuriant growth requires Short gentle showers, and bright ethereal fires. But here, though distant from our native shore, With mutual glee we meet and laugh once more. The same! I know thee by that yellow face, That strong complexion of true Indian race, Which time can never change, nor soil impair, Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air; For endless years, though every mild domain, Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign. But man, more fickle, the bold incense claims, In different realms to give thee different names. Thee the soft nations round the warm Levant polanta call, the French of course polenta; Ev'n in thy native regions, how I blush To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee mush! On Hudson's banks, while men of Belgic spawn Insult and eat thee by the name suppawn. All spurious appellations, void of truth; I've better known thee from my earliest youth, Thy name is Hasty Pudding! thus our sires Were wont to greet thee fuming from their fires; And while they argued in thy just defence With logic clear, they thus explained the sense: ""In haste the boiling cauldron, o'er the blaze, Receives and cooks the ready-powdered maize; In haste 'tis served, and then in equal haste, With cooling milk, we make the sweet repast. No carving to be done, no knife to grate The tender ear, and wound the stony plate; But the smooth spoon, just fitted to the lip, And taught with art the yielding mass to dip, By frequent journeys to the bowl well stored, Performs the hasty honors of the board."" Such is the name, significant and clear, A name, a sound to every Yankee dear, But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste Preserve my pure hereditary taste. There are who strive to stamp with disrepute The luscious food, because it feeds the brute; In tropes of high-strained wit, while gaudy prigs Compare thy nursling, man, to pampered pigs; With sovereign scorn I treat the vulgar jest, Nor fear to share thy bounties with the beast. What though the generous cow gives me to quaff The milk nutritious; am I then a calf? Or can the genius of the noisy swine, Though nursed on pudding, thence lay claim to mine? Sure the sweet song, I fashion to thy praise, Runs more melodious than the notes they raise. My song resounding in its grateful glee, No merit claims; I praise myself in thee. My father loved thee through his length of days; For thee his fields were shaded o'er with maize; From thee what health, what vigor he possessed, Ten sturdy freemen from his loins attest; Thy constellation ruled my natal morn, And all my bones were made of Indian corn. Delicious grain! whatever form ti take, To roast or boil, to smother or to bake, In every dish 'tis welcome still to me, But most, my Hasty Pudding, most in thee. Let the green succotash with thee contend, let beans and corn their sweetest juices blend, Let butter drench them in its yellow tide, And a long slice of bacon grace their side; Not all the plate, how famed soe'er it be, Can please my palate like a bowl of thee. Some talk of hoe-cake, fair Virginia's pride, Rich johnny-cake this mouth has often tried; Both please me well, their virtues much the same; Alike their fabric, as allied their fame, Except in dear New England, where the last Receives a dash of pumpkin in the paste, To give it sweetness and improve the taste. But place them all before me, smoking hot, The big round dumpling rolling from the pot; The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast, With suet lined, leads on the Yankee feast; The charlotte brown, within whose crusty sides A belly soft the pulpy apple hides; The yellow bread, whose face like amber glows, And all of Indian that the bakepan knows-- You tempt me not--my favorite greets my eyes, To that loved bowl my spoon by instinct flies. Canto II To mix the food by vicious rules of art, To kill the stomach and to sink the heart, To make mankind to social virtue sour, Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour; For this the kitchen muse first framed her book, Commanding sweat to stream from every cook; Children no more their antic gambols tried, And friend to physic wandered why they died. Not so the Yankee--his abundant feast, With simples furnished, and with plainness dressed, A numerous offspring gathers round the board, And cheers alike the servant and the lord; Whose well-bought hunger prompts the joyous taste, And health attends them from the short repast. While the full pail rewards the milkmaid's toil, The mother sees the morning cauldron boil; To stir the pudding next demands their care, To spread the table and the bowls prepare; To feed the children, as their portions cool, And comb their heads, and send them off to school. Yet may the simplest dish some rules impart, For nature scorns not all the aids of art. Ev'n Hasty Pudding, purest of all food, May still be bad, indifferent, or good, As sage experience the short process guides, Or want of skill, or want of care presides: Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan, To rear the child and long sustain the man; To shield the morals while it mends the size, And all the powers of every food supplies, Attend the lessons that the muse shall bring. Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing. But since, O man! thy life and health demand Not food alone, but labor from thy hand, First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays, Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize; She loves the race that courts her yielding soil, And gives her bounties to the sons of toil. When now the ox, obedient to thy call, Repays the loan that filled the winter stall, Pursue his traces o'er the furrowed plain, And plant in measured hills the golden grain. But when the tender germ begins to shoot, And the green spire declares the sprouting root, Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe, The insidious worm, the all-devouring crow. A little ashes, sprinkled round the spire, Son steeped in rain, will bid the worm retire; The feathered robber with his hungry maw Swift flies the field before your man of straw, A frightful image, such as schoolboys bring When met to burn the Pope or hang the King. Thrice in the season, through each verdant row Wield the strong plowshare and the faithful hoe; The faithful hoe, a double task that takes, To till the summer corn, and roast the winter cakes. Slow springs the blade, while checked by chilling rains, Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains; But when his fiercest fires emblaze the land, Then start the juices, then the roots expand; Then, like a column of Corinthian mold, The stalk struts upward, and the leaves unfold; The busy branches all the ridges fill, Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill. Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done; Leave the last labors to the parent sun; Beneath his genial smiles the well-dressed field, When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield. Now the strong foliage bears the standards high, And shoots the tall top-gallants to the sky; The suckling ears their silky fringes bend, And pregnant grown, their swelling coats distend; The loaded stalk, while still the burden grows, O'erhangs the space that runs between the rows; High as a hop-field waves the silent grove, A safe retreat for little thefts of love, When the pledged roasting-ears invite the maid, To meet her swain beneath the new-formed shade; His generous hand unloads the cumbrous hill, And the green spoils her ready basket fill; Small compensation for the two-fold bliss, The promised wedding and the present kiss. Slight depredations these; but now the moon Calls from his hollow tree the sly raccoon; And while by night he bears his prize away, The bolder squirrel labors through the day. Both thieves alike, but provident of time, A virtue rare, that almost hides their crime. Then let them steal the little stores they can, And fill their granaries from the toils of man; We've one advantage where they take no part, With all their wiles they ne'er have found the art To boil the Hasty Pudding; here we shine Superior far to tenants of the pine; This envied boon to man shall still belong, Unshared by them in substance or in song. At last the closing season browns the plain, And ripe October gathers in the grain; Deep loaded carts the spacious corn-house fill, The sack distended marches to the mill; The laboring mill beneath the burden grounds, And showers the future pudding from the stones; Till the glad housewife greets the powdered gold, And the new crop exterminates the old. Canto III The days grow short; but though the falling sun To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done, Night's pleasing shades his various talk prolong, And yield new subjects to my various song. For now, the corn-house filled, the harvest home, The invited neighbors to the husking come; A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play, Unite their charms, to chase the hours away. Where the huge heap lies centered in the hall, The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall, Brown corn-fed nymphs, and strong hard-handed beaux, Alternate ranged, extend in circling rows, Assume their seats, the solid mass attack; The dry husks rustle, and the corncobs crack; The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound, And the sweet cider trips in silence round. The laws of husking every wight can tell; And sure no laws he ever keeps so well: For each red ear a general kiss he gains, With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains; But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast, Red as her lips, and taper as her waist, She walks the round, and culls one favored beau, Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow. Various the sport, as are the wits and brains Of well-pleased lasses and contending swains; Till the vast mound of corn is swept away, And he that gets the last ear wins the day. Meanwhile the housewife urges all her care, The well-earned feast to hasten and prepare. The sifted meal already waits her hand, The milk is strained, the bowls in order stand, The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes The headlong stream that o'er the milldam breaks) Foams, roars, and rages with incessant toils, So the vexed cauldron rages, roars, and boils. First with clean salt she seasons well the food, Then strews the flour, and thickens all the flood. Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand; To stir it well demands a stronger hand; The husband takes his turn; and round and round The ladle flies; at last the toil is crowned; When to the board the thronging huskers our, And take their seats as at the corn before. I leave them to their feat. There still belong More copious matters to my faithful song. For rules there are, though ne'er unfolded yet, Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate. Some with molasses line the luscious treat, And mix, like bards, the useful with the sweet. A wholesome dish, and well deserving praise, A great resource in those bleak wintry days, When the chilled earth lies buried deep in snow, And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow. Blessed cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ, Mother of Egypt's God--but sure, for me, Were I to leave my God, I'd worship thee. How oft thy teats these pious hands have pressed! How oft thy bounties proved my only feast! How oft I've fed thee with my favorite grain! And roared, like thee, to find thy children slain! Ye swains who know her various worth to prize, Ah! house her well from winter's angry skies. Potatoes, pumpkins, should her sadness cheer, Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer; When spring returns she'll well acquaint the loan, And nurse at once your infants and her own. Milk then with pudding I should always choose; To this in future I confine my muse, Till she in haste some further hints unfold, Well for the young, nor useless to the old. First in your bowl the milk abundant take, Then drop with are along the silver lake Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide; But when their growing mass no more can sink, When the soft island looms above the brink, Then check your hand; you've got the portion's due, So taught our sires, and what they taught is true. There is a choice in spoons. Though small appear The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear. The deep-bowled Gallie spoon, contrived to scoop In ample draughts the thin diluted soup, Performs not well in those substantial things, Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings; Where the strong labial muscles must embrace, The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space. With ease to enter and discharge the freight, A bowl less concave but still more dilate, Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size, A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes. Experienced feeders can alone impart A rule so much above the lore of art. These tuneful lips that thousand spoons have tried, With just precision could the point decide, Though not in song; the muse but poorly shines In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines; Yet the true form, as near as she can tell, Is that small section of a goose-egg shell, Which in two equal portions shall divide The distance from the center to the side. Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin. Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me, Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee; Just in the zenith your wise head project, Your full spoon, rising in a line direct, Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall, The wide-mouthed bowl will surely catch them all.",https://mypoeticside.com/show-classic-poem-1965,"**The Hasty Pudding** by Joel Barlow In this poem, Joel Barlow celebrates the American dish of hasty pudding, a porridge made from cornmeal.

He saw, once more, bright Del'ware's silver stream, And Penn's throng'd city cast a cheerful gleam; The dome of state, that met his eager eye, Now heav'd its arches in a loftier sky. The bursting gates unfold: and lo, within, A solemn train in conscious glory shine. The well-known forms his eye had trac'd before, In diff'rent realms along th' extended shore; Here, grac'd with nobler fame, and rob'd in state, They look'd and mov'd magnificently great. High on the foremost seat, in living light, Majestic Randolph caught the hero's sight: Fair on his head, the civic crown was plac'd, And the first dignity his sceptre grac'd. He opes the cause, and points in prospect far, Thro' all the toils that wait th' impending war -- But, hapless sage, thy reign must soon be o'er, To lend thy lustre, and to shine no more. So the bright morning star, from shades of ev'n, Leads up the dawn, and lights the front of heav'n, Points to the waking world the sun's broad way, Then veils his own, and shines above the day. And see great Washington behind thee rise, Thy following sun, to gild our morning skies; O'er shadowy climes to pour the enliv'ning flame, The charms of freedom and the fire of fame. Th' ascending chief adorn'd his splendid seat, Like Randolph, ensign'd with a crown of state; Where the green patriot bay beheld, with pride, The hero's laurel springing by its side; His sword, hung useless, on his graceful thigh, On Britain still he cast a filial eye; But sov'reign fortitude his visage bore, To meet their legions on th' invaded shore. Sage Franklin next arose, in awful mien, And smil'd, unruffled, o'er th' approaching scene; High, on his locks of age, a wreath was brac'd, Palm of all arts, that e'er a mortal grac'd; Beneath him lies the sceptre kings have borne, And crowns and laurels from their temples torn. Nash, Rutledge, Jefferson, in council great, And Jay and Laurens op'd the rolls of fate. The Livingstons, fair Freedom's gen'rous band, The Lees, the Houstons, fathers of the land, O'er climes and kingdoms turn'd their ardent eyes, Bade all th' oppressed to speedy vengeance rise; All pow'rs of state, in their extended plan, Rise from consent to shield the rights of man. Bold Wolcott urg'd the all-important cause; With steady hand the solemn scene he draws; Undaunted firmness with his wisdom join'd, Nor kings nor worlds could warp his stedfast mind. Now, graceful rising from his purple throne, In radiant robes, immortal Hosmer shone; Myrtles and bays his learned temples bound, The statesman's wreath, the poet's garland crown'd: Morals and laws expand his liberal soul, Beam from his eyes, and in his accents roll. But lo! an unseen hand the curtain drew, And snatch'd the patriot from the hero's view; Wrapp'd in the shroud of death, he sees descend The guide of nations and the muses' friend. Columbus dropp'd a tear. The angel's eye Trac'd the freed spirit mounting thro' the sky. Adams, enrag'd, a broken charter bore, And lawless acts of ministerial pow'r; Some injur'd right in each loose leaf appears, A king in terrors and a land in tears; From all the guileful plots the veil he drew, With eye retortive look'd creation through; Op'd the wide range of nature's boundless plan, Trac'd all the steps of liberty and man; Crowds rose to vengeance while his accents rung, And Independence thunder'd from his tongue.",https://poetandpoem.com/Joel-Barlow/The-First-American-Congress,"**The First American Congress** By Joel Barlow In Freedom's cause the patriot chiefs convened, And raised the standard of the rights of men; The land, redeemed from feudal chains, was free, And Congress met in Philadelphia's hall.

The chiefs of Freedom met in solemn state, And on their brows the wreath of victory shone; Their hearts were full of joy, their eyes of light, For they had saved their country from the foe. They met to frame a constitution, A charter for the rights of man; A government of laws, not men, A government where all should be equal, free, and just. They worked with zeal and with devotion, And soon the Constitution was complete; A noble instrument, a model of its kind, A bulwark of the rights of man. The Constitution was adopted by the people, And the new government was inaugurated; And thus was founded the great Republic, The hope of the world, the asylum of the oppressed. The First American Congress was a memorable event, A turning-point in the history of the world; It marked the birth of a new nation, A nation dedicated to the principles of freedom and equality. The First American Congress was a triumph of the human spirit, A victory for the cause of liberty; It was a beacon of hope to all who suffer under oppression, A promise of a better future for all mankind.",2634,"Columbus looked; and still around them spread, From south to north, th' immeasurable shade; The sun's bright disk was slowly sinking down, And twilight's dusky shadows gathered round. The sea was calm, and on its glassy breast The waves in gentle undulations slept; The air was still, and not a breath of wind Stirred the broad leaves of the clustering pine. The weary mariners, reclining on The deck, in silent thought or slumber lay; While Columbus, gazing on the darkening west, Mused on the future fortunes of his way. He thought of all the dangers and the toils That yet awaited him on his lonely way; He thought of all the hardships that he must Endure, and all the perils that he must brave. But still his heart was firm, and still his soul Was cheered with hope of future fame and glory; And as he gazed upon the setting sun, He felt that he was destined to achieve a glorious victory. And now the sun had sunk beneath the waves, And darkness gathered o'er the face of the deep; The stars came out, and in their twinkling light The mariners guided their frail bark on its way. And still Columbus gazed upon the west, And still his heart was filled with hope and joy; For he knew that he was nearing the land, The land of which he had so long dreamed. And now the morning dawned, and as the sun Rose up in all its splendor o'er the waves, Columbus beheld the long-desired land, The land that he had sought for so many years. And as he gazed upon the shores of America, He felt that he had achieved a glorious victory, A victory that would be remembered for all time.",2552,,3528,0,0,0,0,FALSE
