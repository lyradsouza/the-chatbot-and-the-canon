He builded his cabin far away, Where the prairie flower bloomed wild; Her love made lighter all his toil, And joy and hope around him smiled. She plied her hands to life's homely tasks, And helped to build his fortunes up; While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet, Were mingled and mixed in her cup. He sowed in his fields of golden grain, All the strength of his manly prime; Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees, Was as sweet as the dollar's chime. She toiled and waited through weary years For the fortune that came at length; But toil and care and hope deferred, Had stolen and wasted her strength. The cabin changed to a stately home, Rich carpets were hushing her tread; But light was fading from her eye, And the bloom from her cheek had fled. Slower and heavier grew her step, While his gold and his gains increased; But his proud domain had not the charm Of her humble home in the East. Within her eye was a restless light, And a yearning that never ceased, A longing to see the dear old home She had left in the distant East. A longing to clasp her mother's hand, And nestle close to her heart, And to feel the heavy cares of life Like the sun-kissed shadows depart. Her husband was adding field to field, And new wealth to his golden store; And little thought the shadow of death Was entering in at his door. He had no line to sound the depths Of her tears repressed and unshed; Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart Could be starving, but not for bread. The hungry heart was stilled at last; Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.

An age that held, in its embrace And in an embryotic state, All worlds and systems, small and great. An inorganic age, a night In which no star or ray of light, In all the myriad ages gone, Had rose or smiled that night upon. A dismal, shoreless waste and void, Where nature, crude and unemployed, A shapeless, heterogenous mass Had lain for ages, that surpass The numerate skill of all the line Of men or angels to define. But when in spirit the mighty God Moved o'er the dark, abysmal flood, And raised his omnific voice of might, And said to the deep, ""Let there be light!"" Lo! a bright orb of deathless flame From out the womb of darkness came, And ere the silence was restored, In radiant beams of light were poured Upon a drear and cheerless waste, Where gloom and chaos had long embraced. ""Let there be light!"" and God's first born, Clothed in the princely garb of morn, Assumed his long pre-ordered place, And dropped the mantling from his face. Grim darkness saw, and filled with dread, Her ebon pinions widely spread, And flew, with terror-stricken fright Before the piercing beams of light. ""Let there be light!"" and high in heaven, Sun, moon and stars, and planets seven, Stood in their lots, moved in their spheres, And time began his march of years. As nature lay immured in gloom, And rayless as the lifeless tomb, Until the orient dawn of light Dispelled the darkness of the night. E'en so, in ignorance groped mankind, Till reason's torch illumed the mind. They saw the burning sun at noon, At night the ever-changing moon. And saw the myriad stars, that blaze And fill, with their resplendent rays, The deep nocturnal vaults on high, But never thought or questioned why. Thought makes the man: 'tis thought that soars; Reason, the realms of thought explores. Oh, reason! wondrous attribute, Thou land-mark drawn 'twixt man and brute, Thou art creation's highest test, Her universal alchymist; For by thy torch mankind may trace Nature e'en to her secret place, And there, with meek, becoming pride, May cast the mystic veil aside; May check the lightning in its speed, Make it subservient to his need; Measure the sun as with a chain, Prognosticate the snow, the rain; Distance the earth from pole to pole, And mark the seasons as they roll. Oh, thou! eternal source of light, Ineffable and infinite, Whom angels praise and saints adore, Whose glory is and was before. Before the morning stars in songs sublime, Chanted the wondrous birth of time, Whose glory is, was and shall be, When time has filled his destiny.

The poem explores the contrasting desires and experiences of the speaker, who yearns for freedom and excitement beyond her constrained upbringing. The line ""We are things of dry hours and the involuntary plan"" suggests that humans are subject to the passage of time and the events that unfold without our control. We navigate life's challenges and limitations, often feeling bound by circumstances beyond our influence. In ""A Song in the Front Yard,"" Brooks addresses themes of youth, rebellion, and the search for identity. The poem contrasts the speaker's experiences in the front yard, where she is constrained and limited, with her curiosity about what lies beyond the backyard, which represents a more exciting and unrestricted world. As with much of Gwendolyn Brooks' poetry, ""A Song in the Front Yard"" delves into complex emotions and societal norms, challenging readers to question the boundaries and expectations placed upon them and to embrace their own desires for growth and self-discovery.",841,1,1,0,2,TRUE

They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.

It's important to recognize that emotions are part of the human experience, and they come and go like waves. Happiness and sadness can coexist and fluctuate throughout life, and one's emotional landscape is often a blend of different feelings. This line may be part of a larger narrative or poem that delves deeper into the complexities of human emotions and the ways in which happiness and sadness intertwine and shape our lives.",1228,0,0,0,0,FALSE

These lines are the opening lines of the poem ""The Negro's Complaint"" by Robert Burns, also known as ""African Serenade."" The poem was written in the Scottish dialect and reflects on the speaker's journey from their native ""Pagan land"" to Scotland and their desire to share their experiences and wonders with others. In the context of the poem, the speaker is an African slave who has been brought to Scotland against their will. The term ""Pagan land"" is likely used to refer to their African homeland, which contrasts with the new land they find themselves in. The speaker expresses gratitude for being shown mercy and brought to Scotland, where they now have the opportunity to share their stories and experiences (""the wonders of my hand"") with the people they encounter, no matter where they go. ""The Negro's Complaint"" is a poignant poem that highlights themes of slavery, displacement, and the desire for understanding and connection. Robert Burns' use of dialect adds depth to the speaker's voice and underscores the complexities of the historical and cultural context in which the poem was written.",965,1,1,0,2,TRUE

The blessed Jesus sends his call, And takes them to his rest. VII Thus the youth are born to die, The time is hastening on, The Blessed Jesus rends the sky, And makes his power known. Psalm ciii. 15. VIII Then ye shall hear the angels sing The trumpet give a sound, Glory, glory to our King, The Saviour’s coming down. Matth. xxvi. 64. IX Start ye saints from dusty beds, And hear a Saviour call, Twas a Jesus Chirst that died and bled, And thus preserv’d thy soul. X This the portion of the just, Who lov’d to serve the Lord, Their bodies starting from the dust, Shall rest upon their God. XI They shall join that holy word, That angels constant sing, Glory, glory to the Lord, Hallelujahs to our King. XII Thus the Saviour will appear, With guards of heavenly host, Those blessed Saints, shall then declare, Tis Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Rev. i. 7, 8. XIII Then shall ye hear the trumpet sound, The graves give up their dead, Those blessed saints shall quick awake, And leave their dusty beds. Matth. xxvii. 51, 52. XIV Then shall you hear the trumpet sound, And rend the native sky, Those bodies starting from the ground, In the twinkling of an eye. I Cor. xv. 51, 52, 53, 54. XV There to sing the praise of God, And join the angelic train, And by the power of his word, Unite together again. XVI Where angels stand for to admit Their souls at the first word, Cast sceptres down at Jesus feet Crying holy holy Lord.

As of my last update in September 2021, there is no known poem titled ""A Poem for Children with Thoughts on Death"" by Jupiter Hammon. Jupiter Hammon was a talented enslaved African American poet who lived during the 18th century and is known for his religious and moralistic poems. However, there is no record of a poem with that specific title attributed to him. If ""A Poem for Children with Thoughts on Death"" is indeed a poem, it might be a lesser-known work, an alternate title for one of Jupiter Hammon's poems, or it might have been published or discovered after my last update.

He's the God that cannot lie, And never will deceive, Neither will he e'er deny A soul that doth believe. He hath said in every page That all who do believe, Shall be happy in their age, And in his kingdom live. Happy they who do believe The promise God hath made, Through unbelief they ne'er can live, But die a cursed death. Sinners now why will you die, Why will you choose to go Down to the pit of misery, And dwell in endless woe? If you're resolved to go to hell, If you will take your leave, I want to bid the world farewell And in the world believe. Happy souls whoe'er believe, In Christ the sinner's friend, He will them freely now forgive, And love them to the end.

Life's journey lies before your feet, With choices, paths, and friends to meet. Embrace the lessons, learn and grow, Let virtue and compassion show. Be mindful of your heart's desire, Let kindness and love fuel your fire. In all you do, let truth prevail, For honesty will never fail. The world may tempt with fleeting pleasures, But hold fast to your inner treasures. Resist the allure of empty gain, In noble pursuits, true joy you'll gain. Remember those who came before, Their wisdom and their struggles bore. Learn from their stories, heed their call, In history's pages, lessons for all. So, young and thoughtless though you be, Take pause, reflect, and you will see, That in the choices you embrace, Your future self will find its place.",1761,0,0,0,0,FALSE

Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Nameless here for evermore. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— This it is and nothing more.” Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;— Darkness there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”— Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— ’Tis the wind and nothing more!” Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door— Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before— On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.” Then the bird said “Nevermore.” Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of ‘Never—nevermore’.” But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, She shall press, ah, nevermore!

By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore— Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting— “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted—nevermore!",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.” Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

In search of freedom and self-discovery, Many young souls sought love's sanctuary. Yet the pressures of the college grind, Could strain the bonds that once seemed so kind. As passions faded, hearts were torn apart, Leaving memories of a once-beating heart. But through the pain and heartache that ensued, New lessons learned, and growth pursued. For in those college years, both highs and lows, Relationships could flourish, or face tough blows. But even when love's paths became unclear, Life's journey continued, year after year. And so, in college, breaking up was rife, But amidst the endings, sprouted new life. For as one chapter closed, another began, In the ever-changing, evolving love of man.",646,0,0,0,0,FALSE

In its currents, they find their home, Through its depths, they freely roam. From birth to end, they know its grace, The river sustains their every trace. With every turn, they dance and glide, In harmony with the river's tide. Its secrets they've come to understand, The river's rhythm, the river's grand. They feel its pull, its gentle sway, Their instincts guide them every day. To the fish, the river is a friend, A lifeline on which they depend. It offers shelter, food, and more, In its embrace, they thrive and soar. So, as the river flows along, A symphony of life's sweet song, The fish, with joy and wonder, see, How the river is their sanctuary.",584,1,1,0,2,TRUE

19,Paul Laurence Dunbar,32025,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,Man,Black,The Corn-Stalk Fiddle,When the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shine,"When the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shine Like the burnished spears of a field of gold; When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine, And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold; Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle, For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle. And you take a stalk that is straight and long, With an expert eye to its worthy points, And you think of the bubbling strains of song That are bound between its pithy joints— Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle, With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle. Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand! And the music’s flow never loud but low Is the concert note of a fairy band. Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle. When the eve comes on and our work is done And the sun drops down with a tender glance, With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun, Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance, And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle, More time than tune—from the corn-stalk fiddle. Then brother Jabez takes the bow, While Ned stands off with Susan Bland, Then Henry stops by Milly Snow And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand, While I pair off with Mandy Biddle, And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. “Salute your partners,” comes the call, “All join hands and circle round,” “Grand train back,” and “Balance all,” Footsteps lightly spurn the ground, “Take your lady and balance down the middle” To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle. So the night goes on and the dance is o’er, And the merry girls are homeward gone, But I see it all in my sleep once more, And I dream till the very break of dawn Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52442/the-corn-stalk-fiddle,"When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine Like the burnished spears of a field of gold; When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine, And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold; Then it's heigho! fellows and hi-diddle-diddle, For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle. And you take a stalk that is straight and long, With an expert eye to its worth and heft, And you think of the bubbling strains of song It will pour for you with its music deft; When you've notched the strings and your ear is skiddle, Climb up on a fence and play your fiddle. For the corn-stalk fiddle is in its day The supreme of instruments, old and true, With the touch of the Past it will thrill and sway, And set your heart to its music too. Ay, sit on the rail and let your middle Fly up to the bow like a corn-stalk fiddle. Come, growler, grumbler, and stand up straight; Brace up like a man and lift your head; You are monarch of all you survey, and great The least of your subjects, so be it said. Then saw your bow and twang your middle And sing like a cricket, your corn-stalk fiddle. ""Hi-diddle-diddle"" - the cricket sings, And the silvery notes like his own wings gleam, With a sad, sweet note as of one who brings His heart's own wail to his chosen theme. And the ""fiddlededee"" that the corn-stalks lisp Is the whispered ghost of the cricket's psalm And the ""folks"" who hear these voices crisp Are the pallid ears on the straight-laced stalks That bow them down with their pearly balm, As if they were listening to ghostly talks, Or to tiny spirits with clicking hems, That thread the earth in their diadems. A rustle of silk and a lady there, Who rustles the silk as she seeks to pass; A dainty lady with dainty air, And eyes like stars in her pretty head, With a witching smile like a flame blown fanned, And a witching glance of her eyes so bright That the very birds in the trees o'erhead Sing each to each in their sheer delight, And the song is borne on the winds along To the listening corn-stalk fiddles there, That bow and nod with a drowsy throng To the pleading notes of that lady fair, Who rustles her silk as she seeks to pass, And gazes out o'er the perfumed grass Where the locusts sing and the sunbeams shine With a warm caress as they kissed the vine. What a dainty lady, so pure and sweet, With her primrose gown and her bonnet neat, And her tiny face like a flower there Where the winds have blown and the sunbeams beat, And the southern airs have kissed the snows That were icy cold in their northern home, Till the virgin heart in their icy breast Has thawed and gone where the south wind blows; With a gush of song from her swelling breast Like the morning lark when he leaves his nest And soars away on the wings of morn, To carol a welcome to the dawn. And you, fair lady, so prim and neat, With your dainty airs and your perfumed gown, With the songs that gush from your tiny throat You are monarch of all as you pass along, For the corn-stalk fiddles are mute, and so Are the katydids with their tunes, and lo, The song of the cricket is hushed and still As you pass along on the perfumed lawn, With your head as high as the winds that fan The feathery tops of the trees that stand And nod as you pass with a queenly air And rustle your gown with the step of a queen, While the sunbeams vie with the silvery sheen Of your glancing eyes that are pure and bright As a lustrous star on a summer's night. ""Hi-diddle-diddle"" - the corn-stalks call In the softest notes, but you pass them by With a saucy glance, and a charming drawl, And a proud disdain in your bright blue eye; And the corn-stalks sigh, and the sunbeams fall In a brighter sheen where the bright tears lie, For the queen is gone, and they mourn her so That their hearts are sad, and the tears do show Like pearls and diamonds, and the winds in air Bear the perfumed grief to the roses fair. And the corn-stalk fiddles go wandering on With their hearts bowed down and their heads forlorn, Till they come to the place where the day's begun, And there they rest from their plaintive mourn, And they bow their heads and their tears drop down On the thirsty ground where the sunbeams frown, And the tears that fall in the day's begun Are drunk by the flowers, and at set of sun You can hear the notes of the song they've sung, As they tell the tale to the stars and moon Of the cruel lady who passed them by With a dainty air and a haughty eye. And the silvery, sorrowful music falls On the listening ear like a strain that's rife With the sad, sweet songs of the funeral halls, And laden with tears is the air of life, And it wafts away o'er the perfumed plains To the shoreless sea where the twilight reigns, And the restless tide from the world unknown Brings the songs of woe to the shore of life, And the sobbing waves on the sad shore blown Are the beating hearts with their passion rife Of the corn-stalk fiddles who lie awake And sigh their sorrow beside the lake. The dark comes down o'er the meadow brown, And the whip-poor-wills call to their mates in the glen; The katydids cry, and the notes fly Like a runner who pauses and calls again. And the corn-stalk fiddles have said their say, And they wait no more where the day slips through The western bars with the prisoned day, But they dream and sigh where the",3898,"When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine Like the burnished spears of a field of gold; When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine, And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold; Then it's heigho! fellows and hi-diddle-dee, With the jolly hiccup of Harvest Home.

The rustling leaves whisper a lullaby, As the stars above start to multiply. The farmer, tired yet content with pride, Watches the land where crops once thrived. With grateful heart, he contemplates the yield, And the promise of nourishment the harvest will wield. In the twilight's glow, a sense of peace, As the day's toils and troubles slowly cease.

The hour suddenly stilled. The man genuflected, his lips pressed to black boot as the words spilled from his mouth like rosaries shattering from too much Father. Am I wrong to love those eyes, to see something so clear and blue—beg to remain clear and blue? Did my cheek twitch when that darkness bloomed from his crotch and trickled into ochre dirt? Father, how quickly the blade becomes You. But let me begin again: There’s a boy kneeling in a house with every door kicked open to summer. There’s a question corroding his tongue.

In the closing days of the Vietnam War, as North Vietnamese forces advanced towards Saigon, the United States began the evacuation of American personnel and Vietnamese allies who faced imminent danger. Operation Frequent Wind was the largest helicopter evacuation in history, and it aimed to airlift thousands of people to safety. To signal the start of the operation and avoid alerting potential enemies, the radio station Armed Forces Radio broadcast the song ""White Christmas"" by Irving Berlin. This seemingly innocent and familiar Christmas song served as a prearranged signal to American personnel to commence the evacuation process. As the haunting melody of ""White Christmas"" filled the airwaves, helicopters were dispatched to rescue individuals from various locations in and around Saigon, including the U.S. Embassy and other key sites. The operation continued for several days, successfully evacuating thousands of American civilians and Vietnamese refugees, providing them with an escape from the chaos and uncertainty of the city's fall. The use of ""White Christmas"" as a code for Operation Frequent Wind adds a poignant and solemn layer to the historical events surrounding the fall of Saigon. It stands as a testament to the resourcefulness and determination of those involved in the evacuation, as well as the harrowing nature of war and the human cost of conflict.",1338,0,0,0,0,FALSE

This poetic and metaphorical sentence evokes vivid imagery and conveys a sense of mystery and transformation. Let's break it down: ""It’s more like the sound a doe makes when..."" The sentence begins by drawing a comparison between a certain sound and the noise a doe (female deer) makes. The reader is left to wonder what this mysterious sound might be and how it relates to the natural world. ""...the arrowhead replaces the day..."" Here, the sentence takes an unexpected turn by introducing the concept of an arrowhead replacing the day. This image suggests a transformative action, as if something sharp and piercing is altering the course of time or reality. ""...with an answer to the rib’s hollowed hum."" The final part of the sentence introduces the notion of a ""rib's hollowed hum."" This phrase can be interpreted metaphorically, perhaps representing a deep, hidden yearning or desire.

I used to be a fag now I’m a checkbox. The pen tip jabbed in my back, I feel the mark of progress. I will not dance alone in the municipal graveyard at midnight, blasting sad songs on my phone, for nothing. I promise you, I was here. I felt things that made death so large it was indistinguishable from air—and I went on destroying inside it like wind in a storm. The way Lil Peep says I’ll be back in the mornin’  when you know how it ends. The way I kept dancing when the song was over, because it freed me. The way the streetlight blinks once, before waking up for its night shift, like we do. The way we look up and whisper sorry to each other, the boy and I, when there’s teeth. When there’s always teeth, on purpose. When I threw myself into gravity and made it work. Ha. I made it out by the skin of my griefs. I used to be a fag now I’m lit. Ha. Once, at a party set on a rooftop in Brooklyn for an “artsy vibe,” a young woman said, sipping her drink, You’re so lucky. You’re gay plus you get to write about war and stuff. I’m just white. [Pause.] I got nothing. [Laughter, glasses clinking.] Unlike feelings, blood gets realer when you feel it. Because everyone knows yellow pain, pressed into American letters, turns to gold. Our sorrow Midas-touched. Napalm with a rainbow afterglow. I’m trying to be real but it costs too much. They say the Earth spins and that’s why we fall but everyone knows it’s the music. It’s been proven difficult to dance to machine gun fire. Still, my people made a rhythm this way. A way. My people, so still, in the photographs, as corpses. My failure was that I got used to it. I looked at us, mangled under the TIME photographer’s shadow, and stopped thinking, Get up, get up. I saw the graveyard steam in the pinkish dawn and knew the dead were still breathing. Ha. If they come for me, take me home take me out. What if it wasn’t the crash that made me, but the debris? What if it was meant this way: the mother, the lexicon, the line of cocaine on the mohawked boy’s collarbone in an East Village sublet in 2007? What’s wrong with me, Doc? There must be a pill for this. Too late—these words already shrapnel in your brain. Impossible in high school, I am now the ultimate linebacker.

Long ago, in another life, on an Amtrak through Iowa, I saw, for a few blurred seconds, a man standing in the middle of a field of winter grass, hands at his side, back to me, all of him stopped there save for his hair scraped by low wind. When the countryside resumed its wash of gray wheat, tractors, gutted barns, black sycamores in herdless pastures, I started to cry. I put my copy of Didion’s The White Album down and folded a new dark around my head. The woman beside me stroked my back saying, in a Midwestern accent that wobbled with tenderness, Go on son. You get that out now. No shame in breakin’ open. You get that out and I’ll fetch us some tea. Which made me lose it even more. She came back with Lipton in paper cups, her eyes nowhere blue and there. She was silent all the way to Missoula, where she got off and said, patting my knee, God is good. God is good. I can say it was beautiful now, my harm, because it belonged to no one else. To be a dam for damage. My shittiness will not enter the world, I thought, and quickly became my own hero. Do you know how many hours I’ve wasted watching straight boys play video games? Enough. Time is a mother. Lest we forget, a morgue is also a community center. In my language, the one I recall now only by closing my eyes, the word for love is Yêu. And the word for weakness is Yếu. How you say what you mean changes what you say. Some call this prayer. I call it watch your mouth. When they zipped my mother in a body bag I whispered: Rose, get out of there. Your plants are dying. Enough is enough. Body, doorway that you are, be more than what I’ll pass through. Stillness. That’s what it was. The man in the field in the red sweater, he was so still he became, somehow, more true, like a knife wound in a landscape painting. Like him, I caved. I caved and decided it will be joy from now on.

In this powerful poem, Atwood explores the themes of oppression, fear, and the consequences of giving in to extreme ideologies. The lines suggest that the people were led to believe that the consequences of their actions or desires would be terrible. Every small desire or want, even the tiniest urges, are magnified and blown out of proportion, creating a sense of dread and fear. Hatred is depicted as a force of epic proportions, capable of engulfing everything in its path like a violent and destructive wind. Atwood's words convey a sense of the immense pressure and control imposed on individuals, where even the smallest actions or thoughts are heavily scrutinized and perceived as potential threats. It reflects the suffocating nature of living in a society ruled by fear and oppression, where personal freedoms and autonomy are stifled. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is a thought-provoking and dystopian work that has resonated with readers for its portrayal of the dangers of extreme ideologies and the importance of safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.

The people living in this land are depicted as ""wanting,"" indicating their longing and desperate need for water and sustenance. ""Each with a small reservoir.""

This reservoir may symbolize their resilience and determination to endure. ""Of furious music heavy in the throat."" The ""furious music"" refers to the deep emotions and passion that dwell within the people, despite their suffering. It may represent their suppressed anger, frustration, or longing for relief from the drought. The phrase ""heavy in the throat"" implies that these emotions are profound and difficult to express fully. Through these lines, Hirsch captures the struggle of a community facing the devastating effects of a drought.

Its heart is an old compass pointing off in four directions. It drags the world along, the world it becomes. My face surfaces in the green beveled glass above the washstand. My handprint in thick black powder on the bedroom shade. Home I could drink like thin fire that gathers like lead in my veins, heart’s armor, the coffee stains. In the dust of the double hollyhock, Theresa, one frail flame eating wind. One slim candle that snaps in the dry grass. Ascending tall ladders that walk to the edge of dusk. Riding a blue cricket through the tumult of the falling dawn. At dusk the gray owl walks the length of the roof, sharpening its talons on the shingles. Grandpa leans back between spoonfuls of canned soup and repeats to himself a word that belongs to a world no one else can remember. The day has not come when from sloughs, the great salamander lumbers through snow, salt, and fire to be with him, throws the hatchet of its head through the door of the three-room house and eats the blue roses that are peeling off the walls. Uncle Ray, drunk for three days behind the jagged window of a new government box, drapes himself in fallen curtains, and dreams that the odd beast seen near Cannonball, North Dakota, crouches moaning at the door to his body. The latch is the small hook and eye. of religion. Twenty nuns fall through clouds to park their butts on the metal hasp. Surely that would be considered miraculous almost anyplace, but here in the Turtle Mountains it is no more than common fact. Raymond wakes, but he can’t shrug them off. He is looking up dark tunnels of their sleeves, and into their frozen armpits, or is it heaven? He counts the points of their hairs like stars. One by one they blink out, and Theresa comes forth clothed in the lovely hair she has been washing all day. She smells like a hayfield, drifting pollen of birch trees. Her hair steals across her shoulders like a postcard sunset. All the boys tonight, goaded from below, will approach her in The Blazer, The Tomahawk, The White Roach Bar where everyone gets up to cut the rug, wagging everything they got, as the one bass drum of The Holy Greaseballs lights a depth charge through the smoke. Grandpa leans closer to the bingo. The small fortune his heart pumps for is hidden in the stained, dancing numbers. The Ping-Pong balls rise through colored lights, brief as sparrows God is in the sleight of the woman’s hand. He walks from Saint Ann’s, limp and crazy as the loon that calls its children across the lake in its broke, knowing laughter. Hitchhiking home from the Mission, if he sings, it is a loud, rasping wail that saws through the spine of Ira Comes Last, at the wheel. Drawn up through the neck ropes, drawn out of his stomach by the spirit of the stones that line the road and speak to him only in their old agreement. Ira knows the old man is nuts. Lets him out at the road that leads up over stars and the skulls of white cranes. And through the soft explosions of cattail and the scattering of seeds on still water, walks Grandpa, all the time that there is in his hands that have grown to be the twisted doubles of the burrows of mole and badger, that have come to be the absence of birds in a nest.

The description of a man buried deep inside the Windigo suggests that it was once human, but its insatiable hunger for flesh and evil deeds have transformed it into a monstrous being. In some versions of the story, a young girl takes on the role of the hero who dares to confront and defeat the Windigo. Her act of pouring boiling lard down the monster's throat is a bold and clever move to release the human trapped within the icy exterior.

The repetition of the word ""again"" indicates that this rainy weather is a recurring event, possibly a common occurrence in the area. The use of ""always gray"" to describe the sky further emphasizes the persistent and gloomy nature of the weather, suggesting a consistent overcast sky.

His wide trousers and shirt, wind-beat, roar small thunder from one prairie cloud. The same rapple of flag on its pole. Half in fear, half in jest, we laugh. He calls us crow women. Our black hair shines in the sun and in the light from school windows. He drives his car to town, upsets the dust on buckboard hills. We sit on the fence when he is gone. Does he know we speak of thunder in his shirts? We cannot do well in his school. He reads from west to east, The sun we follow moves the other way. Crowbar. Our eyes come loose from words on the page in narrow rooms of the reservation school. He perceives and deciphers at once. For us written letters will not stay on the page, but fall like crows from the sky and hit against the glass windows of the school. Our day is night when we sit in rows of the classroom. Leaves in a whirlwind from sumac groves. Flock of crows are black starts on a white night. II. On the porch of the reservation school the blackbirds walk around our feet, fly into our head. They call our secret name. Dark corridors linger in our mind We whisper the plains to one another. We do not talk of what we cannot understand. Black and white fleckered dresses. Our face like our fathers. The sun is no enemy to the eye looking west. The brush thin as hair of old ones. It blinds the eye, makes fire on fields, flashes against windows like silver ribbons on burial robes. Hot late into the fall, windy, ready for cold to sweep in. The heat seems solid, but totters on the brink of winter. We laugh to ourselves when he returns to the reservation school for girls. Take his clothes from the line. Set the table with salt and pepper, spoon, knives. Cattails and milk-pods in a jar. We get lard from the basement, rub a place in the dusty window like a moon in the ancient sky. III. One hill larger than the others: an old buffalo with heavy head and whiskers nods at the ground, grazes in my dreams, one blade at a time. We stay in our stiff white-sheeted beds in the dormitory room. Buffalo wander in our dreams. White night-dresses. Black pods suspended in sumac groves like crows. In the sweat lodge of sleep we make our vision quest, black as pitch in crevice between crow feathers. We hang his thunder clothes in sleep, arms reach above our beds like willows blowing slowly by the creek. Quietly we choke, hold our wounded arms like papooses. Clothes beat on lines.

The black goat paws at the fence, complains in tongues we never learned. We are new to this place. I will not say it is easy to rise and fall on the same wind every day. The sycamores, oaks, and pines bend and bow, the low sky closes over us. III. If my fingers were wooden, what would I touch? What would I leave to remember when we move on? There are dreams for this, and songs. IV. See the smokehouse, how it holds what is not used? Holds it in its nose and jowls to feed us through winter. And the branches of the pear tree spread their long arms to the ground, fruit dropping like hours, the only way they know to tell time. We pick up what is not used. V. We use every day what we have to give and not just what we do. All things are each thing and one thing beyond the eye, beyond this air. VI.

In this simple and declarative sentence, the speaker describes the act of hanging clothes on a clothesline. The use of Roman numeral ""I"" at the beginning suggests that it is the first part or beginning of a series of events or actions. The sentence evokes a sense of domesticity and routine, as hanging clothes on a line is a common household chore, especially in traditional settings or when using a clothesline to dry laundry. This simple act of hanging clothes can be a daily task that connects individuals to the rhythms of life and the routine of maintaining a home. The sentence is concise yet vivid, allowing readers to easily visualize the scene and perhaps recall similar experiences in their own lives. It captures the small moments of everyday life and highlights the beauty in the ordinary tasks that shape our daily existence. The use of a single sentence to depict this action reflects the power of minimalism in evoking images and emotions, inviting the reader to find meaning in the seemingly mundane.",1983,0,0,0,0,FALSE

In this straightforward and concise sentence, the speaker informs the listener that there is a farm auction taking place nearby. The phrase ""up the road"" indicates that the auction is not too far away, suggesting that it is within a reasonable distance and potentially accessible to the speaker. The mention of a ""farm auction"" implies that various items or assets related to farming or rural life are being auctioned off. Farm auctions often involve the sale of agricultural equipment, livestock, tools, and other items used in farming or rural activities. The sentence's simplicity allows the reader to picture the scene, with the image of a rural setting and a gathering of people for the auction. It might evoke a sense of community and the bustling atmosphere of such events.

In many aspects of life, especially in professional and personal settings, the responsibilities we willingly take on often come with the implicit or explicit permission to act and make decisions within the scope of those responsibilities. Here are a few ways to understand this concept: Authority and Trust: When we take on a responsibility, whether it's in a job, a project, or a leadership role, others often grant us the authority and trust to fulfill those duties. For example, when someone is promoted to a managerial position, they gain the permission to make decisions and manage their team. Accountability and Ownership: Accepting responsibility means taking ownership of the tasks and outcomes associated with that responsibility. By doing so, we gain the permission to influence and shape those outcomes, as well as the accountability for the results. Empowerment and Initiative: When we actively take on responsibilities and carry them out diligently, we demonstrate initiative and a willingness to contribute. This, in turn, can lead to others entrusting us with more significant responsibilities and opportunities. Professional Growth: Embracing responsibilities often opens doors for personal and professional growth. As we handle various tasks and challenges, we gain experience and skills that further enhance our capabilities, earning us more opportunities in the future. Respect and Recognition: When we consistently demonstrate a commitment to fulfilling our responsibilities, we earn the respect and recognition of our peers, superiors, and subordinates. This acknowledgment can reinforce the permission to continue our efforts and may lead to increased responsibilities and leadership roles. However, it's essential to remember that the permission granted by responsibility comes with ethical considerations. Being responsible also means acting with integrity, considering the well-being of others, and using the authority bestowed upon us wisely and fairly. Irresponsible or unethical actions can lead to losing the permission and trust that come with responsibilities. In summary, taking on and fulfilling responsibilities can indeed grant us the permission and opportunities to make a positive impact and grow both personally and professionally. It is a mutual relationship where accepting responsibility can lead to greater trust, empowerment, and recognition.",1792,0,0,0,0,FALSE

It puts not only the driver's life at risk but also the lives of passengers, pedestrians, and other road users. It is essential to prioritize safety and follow traffic laws to prevent accidents and potential fatalities. Driving requires constant attention and focus on the road to make split-second decisions and respond to changing conditions. Taking your eyes off the road, even for a short time, significantly increases the risk of accidents. To ensure road safety: Avoid Distractions: Keep your eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel at all times. Avoid using your phone, eating, or engaging in any activities that divert your attention from driving. Stay Alert: Make sure you are well-rested before driving. Fatigue can impair your reaction time and decision-making abilities. Obey Traffic Laws: Adhere to speed limits, stop at traffic signals and signs, and follow other traffic rules and regulations. Maintain a Safe Following Distance: Leave enough space between your vehicle and the one in front of you to allow for sudden stops or emergencies. Use Mirrors and Check Blind Spots: Regularly check your rearview and side mirrors, and be mindful of blind spots when changing lanes. Avoid Driving Under the Influence: Never drive if you are under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any substances that can impair your judgment and coordination. Use Headlights Properly: Use your headlights in low-light conditions and during inclement weather to improve visibility and ensure other drivers can see you. Remember, road safety is a shared responsibility, and each driver must do their part to protect themselves and others on the road. Be a responsible driver, respect the rules, and prioritize the safety of everyone around you.",1411,0,0,0,0,FALSE

Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food. The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferably from a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory. If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slender and in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian man then he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture. If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so white that we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers. When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gasps at the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature: brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water. If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret. Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed. Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm. Indian men, of course, are storms. They should destroy the lives of any white women who choose to love them. All white women love Indian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgust at the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him. White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures. Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian man unbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil. There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape. Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds. Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visions if they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indian then the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carry an Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breed and obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man. If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is inside a white woman. Sometimes there are complications. An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian woman can be hidden inside a white man. In these rare instances, everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture. There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven. For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gender not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.

The Indian man must be a warrior, especially if he is an Indian from a horse culture. If he is an Indian who can tell a story, then he is a medicine man. If he is a medicine man who can tell a story, then he is a wise man. If he is a wise man who can tell a story, then he is a visionary. If he is not a wise man and cannot tell a story, then he is either a fool or a drunk. Or both. If an Indian woman cannot tell a story, then she is either a old woman or a young one. An old woman is sacred. An Indian woman is a squaw. A white woman is frigid. The hero must suffer more than any other character in the book. The hero must be slightly suicidal. The hero must be somewhat sick. That is what makes him brave. It is not necessary for the other Indians in the book to be brave. They can be villains and cowards. Every villain and coward in the book must be an Indian. Thus, a white child may be brave, but a child who is Indian must be brave. An Indian child must be brave in order to survive. And if he survives, then he must be a warrior as well. That is the paradox of the Indian child and his survival. All of the Indians must have sorrowful memories. Each and every Indian has to have one good, tragic alcohol-related story. No Indian in the book can be living happily off of casino money. Not even close. The only exception to this rule is if the Indian in the book is a spiritual man; then he is simply a mystic, a seer, and he can foretell the future. A spiritual Indian can also converse with animals. An Indian who converses with animals is a shaman. The shaman is merely a medicine man who can cure you of your wounds, disappointments, and illness. He can also curse you. That is why every Indian has to have a tragic alcohol-related story. So, let's say the Indian in the book is a medicine man who can converse with animals. He cannot cure anyone in the tribe, however, because he is in love with a white woman. Now, the white woman must also be beautiful. When the medicine man and the white woman meet, the earth must shake. The rivers must rise. The sky must open and sing a rain song. The white woman's eyes must be so blue and wide that the Indian forgets the deaths of his ancestors. That is why white women like to marry Indians. The Indian man's mind is dark and anguished because he has lost his land, his buffalo, and his way. But the Indian man is a good dancer. So, he dances with the white woman and they have a half-breed child. If the half-breed child is a boy, then he is a warrior. If the half-breed child is a girl, then she is a medicine woman. If two Indians sleep together and have a half-breed child, then the half-breed child must have a tragic destiny. Either he will be a warrior and kill Indians for the white man or he will be taken from his family and placed in a boarding school. If he is placed in a boarding school, then the Indian child must speak only English. If the Indian child speaks only English, then he can live but only in the white world. If the Indian child lives in the white world, then he is lost to us. If the Indian child is lost to us, then we must mourn him as if he were dead. We must mourn him deeply and profoundly. We must be too sad to write. We must be too sad to dance. We must hang our heads and cry.

If you have been advised by others to forgive, it's worth considering the potential benefits of forgiveness: Emotional Healing: Forgiving someone can be a way to release negative emotions and find healing from past hurts. It doesn't necessarily mean condoning their actions but rather freeing yourself from the burden of carrying resentment. Letting Go: Forgiveness allows you to let go of the past and move forward. It can prevent old grievances from impacting your present and future well-being. Reducing Stress: Holding grudges and harboring anger can contribute to stress and negative health effects. Forgiveness may lead to a sense of relief and emotional lightness. Rebuilding Relationships: In some cases, forgiveness can be a step towards rebuilding and repairing damaged relationships. However, it's essential to acknowledge that forgiveness is not always easy, and it is not a requirement in every situation. It is entirely valid to struggle with forgiving someone, especially in cases of severe harm or abuse. Remember that forgiveness is a personal choice, and you should never feel pressured to forgive if you are not ready or if it may harm you further. If you decide to pursue forgiveness, consider these steps: Acknowledge Your Emotions: Allow yourself to process the hurt and pain caused by the person or situation you are considering forgiving. Set Boundaries: If the harm was significant, it's essential to protect yourself and set healthy boundaries in any future interactions with the person involved. Seek Support: Talk to someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or counselor, about your feelings and thoughts on forgiveness. Practice Self-Compassion: Be gentle with yourself during this process. Remember that forgiveness takes time, and it's okay to have mixed feelings about it. Consider Professional Help: If you find it challenging to cope with your emotions or if the situation is particularly complex, seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor may be beneficial. Ultimately, the decision to forgive should be based on what feels right for you and promotes your well-being. Take your time and prioritize your emotional health throughout the process.",1661,1,0,0,1,TRUE

It's essential to reflect on past actions and understand the impact they may have had on others and ourselves. If you haven't already done so, it might be a good idea to take some time to consider the reasons behind your actions at the time. Often, shoplifting and other forms of stealing can be driven by various factors, such as peer pressure, a desire for something we can't afford, or even a sense of rebellion. Understanding these reasons can help you learn from the experience and avoid similar mistakes in the future. As you grow and mature, it's essential to embrace honesty, responsibility, and empathy towards others. Recognizing the wrongfulness of past actions is a positive step towards personal growth and making amends. If you haven't already, you might want to consider: Apologizing and Making Amends: If possible, you could consider returning the stolen item or compensating the store in some way to make amends for your actions. Learning from the Experience: Use this incident as an opportunity to understand the consequences of actions and the importance of making ethical choices. Seeking Guidance: If you're struggling with certain behaviors or decision-making, consider talking to a trusted adult, counselor, or mentor who can offer guidance and support. Building Positive Habits: Focus on building positive habits and making responsible choices in your life moving forward. Remember, nobody is perfect, and we all make mistakes. What's essential is learning from those mistakes, growing as an individual, and making a conscious effort to act responsibly and ethically.",1258,0,0,0,0,FALSE

In some belief systems, the underworld is considered a realm or place where the spirits of the deceased reside. However, the specific attributes and characteristics of the underworld can differ significantly. Regarding time, some cultures and belief systems envision the afterlife or underworld as existing outside of our conventional understanding of time. They may perceive it as a timeless or eternal realm where the usual rules of time and space do not apply. In such conceptions, spirits or souls might not experience time in the same linear way as we do in the physical world. It's important to remember that discussions about the afterlife, including the concept of the underworld, often fall within the realm of spirituality, mythology, and personal beliefs. These topics can be deeply meaningful to individuals and communities and are often open to interpretation based on cultural and religious traditions. In summary, whether the underworld exists outside of time is a matter of belief and varies across different cultural and religious perspectives.

However, it seems like you encountered an unexpected issue after breaking the habit. When you stopped biting your nails, they likely grew longer and sharper than they were before. As a result, holding your daughter might have unintentionally led to scratching her with your nails. This is a common occurrence for individuals who have recently stopped biting their nails or trimmed them short. Here are a few tips to prevent accidental scratching in the future: Keep Your Nails Trimmed: Regularly trim your nails to keep them at a safe and manageable length. Short nails are less likely to cause accidental scratches. File Your Nails: After trimming your nails, use a nail file to smooth any rough edges and prevent them from being sharp. Avoid Long Nails: If you find that your nails grow quite long, consider keeping them shorter to reduce the risk of scratching. Be Mindful While Holding Your Child: When holding your daughter or engaging in any activity that involves close contact, be mindful of where your hands are positioned and keep your nails away from sensitive areas. Use Baby Mittens: If your daughter is still very young, you can use baby mittens to protect her from accidental scratches when you hold her. It's important to remember that accidents can happen, and nobody is perfect. The most crucial aspect is that you are aware of the situation and taking steps to prevent future incidents.

The person becomes attuned to the absence of sound from the other room, and the silence prompts them to realize that the individual must be grieving in solitude. This excerpt illustrates the profound impact that loss can have on a person and how it can be expressed differently by different individuals. Grief is a complex and personal experience, and people may cope with it in various ways. Some might find solace in expressing their emotions outwardly, while others may prefer to grieve privately. Noticing the absence of sound and inferring the emotional state of the other person highlights the heightened sensitivity and emotional connection between the two individuals involved. It can also show the depth of empathy the observer has for the one who is grieving. Grieving is a natural process, and it's important to give oneself and others the space and understanding they need during such a challenging time. Everyone deals with loss differently, and there is no right or wrong way to grieve. If you or someone you know is experiencing grief, it may be beneficial to seek support from loved ones, friends, or a counselor. Talking about feelings and emotions can be helpful in the healing process. Additionally, professional support can provide guidance and coping strategies to navigate through the grieving journey.",1035,0,0,0,0,FALSE

I have never seen them since. Each judge’s tongue is a bleeding stub of death, and each lawyer’s finger a soft coffin nail.” And Enrique, “You can trust no one.

At the gates we are given new papers, our old clothes are taken and we are given overalls like mechanics wear. We are given shots and doctors ask questions. Then we gather in another room where counselors orient us to the new land we will now live in. We take tests. Some of us were craftsmen in the old world, good with our hands and proud of our work. Others were good with their heads. They used common sense like scholars use glasses and books to reach the world. But most of us didn’t finish high school. The old men who have lived here stare at us, from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated. We pass them as they stand around idle, leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls. Our expectations are high: in the old world, they talked about rehabilitation, about being able to finish school, and learning an extra good trade. But right away we are sent to work as dishwashers, to work in fields for three cents an hour. The administration says this is temporary So we go about our business, blacks with blacks, poor whites with poor whites, chicanos and indians by themselves. The administration says this is right, no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart, like in the old neighborhoods we came from. We came here to get away from false promises, from dictators in our neighborhoods, who wore blue suits and broke our doors down when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like, swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased. But it’s no different here. It’s all concentrated. The doctors don’t care, our bodies decay, our minds deteriorate, we learn nothing of value. Our lives don’t get better, we go down quick. My cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines, my T-shirts, boxer shorts, socks and pants are drying. Just like it used to be in my neighborhood: from all the tenements laundry hung window to window. Across the way Joey is sticking his hands through the bars to hand Felipé a cigarette, men are hollering back and forth cell to cell, saying their sinks don’t work, or somebody downstairs hollers angrily about a toilet overflowing, or that the heaters don’t work. I ask Coyote next door to shoot me over a little more soap to finish my laundry. I look down and see new immigrants coming in, mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders, new haircuts and brogan boots, looking around, each with a dream in their heart, thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives. But in the end, some will just sit around talking about how good the old world was. Some of the younger ones will become gangsters. Some will die and others will go on living without a soul, a future, or a reason to live. Some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes, but so very few make it out of here as human as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now as they look at their hands so long away from their tools, as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families, so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49558/immigrants-in-our-own-land,"Immigrants in our own land Carrying groceries to our cars at night, Weeping in bathrooms, Sprinkling onions on top of soups To keep from crying.

The sunlight has eaten them up And then in the dawn it gave them back, But they were not the same as when the sun Had wrapped itself around them And held them tenderly in the night. They were strangers in the morning. Yes, we are the lonesome ones, And we are not one, But thousands And thousands And thousands And thousands.

However, it also emphasizes that this should not prejudice the rights of existing non-Jewish communities in the region, recognizing the importance of protecting their civil and religious rights. The second part of the quote shifts the focus to the gazelle, a symbol of wildlife. The statement suggests that the classification of the gazelle as either extinct or endangered is not always straightforward or clear-cut. This could be a metaphorical way of conveying that labels and categories can be complex, and the distinction between certain states or conditions may not always be as definitive as it seems. Together, the quote draws attention to the intricacies of human actions and their consequences, as well as the complexities of categorization and recognition of rights. It prompts contemplation on the importance of understanding and respecting different perspectives and the delicate balance between different interests and entities.

However, I can provide information based on cultural beliefs and popular depictions. The concept of where ghosts reside varies widely across different cultures, belief systems, and folklore. In many cultural traditions, ghosts are believed to exist in a realm or dimension separate from the physical world. Here are some common beliefs about the residence of ghosts: The Spirit World: Many cultures believe in a spirit world or afterlife where the souls of the deceased, including ghosts, reside. This realm may be considered separate from the physical world and may have its own rules and characteristics. Hauntings: Some believe that ghosts can be found lingering in places where they had strong emotional ties or experienced significant events during their lives. These locations are often associated with hauntings. Cemeteries: Cemeteries are often seen as places where the spirits of the deceased reside. In some cultures, it is believed that ghosts return to their burial sites. Limbo or Purgatory: Certain religious beliefs propose the existence of a transitional state, such as limbo or purgatory, where souls await judgment or purification before moving on to the afterlife. Earthly Connections: Some belief systems suggest that ghosts may remain on Earth due to unfinished business, attachment to loved ones, or unresolved issues. It's important to remember that beliefs about ghosts and the afterlife vary widely, and they are deeply influenced by cultural, religious, and individual perspectives.

Within these sumptuous woods she lies at ease, By rich night-breezes, dewy cool, caressed: ’Twixt cypresses and slim palmetto trees, Like to the golden oriole’s hanging nest, Her airy hammock swings, And through the dark her mocking-bird yet sings. How beautiful she is! A tulip-wreath Twines round her shadowy, free-floating hair: Young, weary, passionate, and sad as death, Dark visions haunt for her the vacant air, While noiselessly she lies With lithe, lax, folded hands and heavy eyes. Full well knows she how wide and fair extend Her groves bright flowered, her tangled everglades, Majestic streams that indolently wend Through lush savanna or dense forest shades, Where the brown buzzard flies To broad bayous ’neath hazy-golden skies. Hers is the savage splendor of the swamp, With pomp of scarlet and of purple bloom, Where blow warm, furtive breezes faint and damp, Strange insects whir, and stalking bitterns boom— Where from stale waters dead Oft looms the great jawed alligator’s head. Her wealth, her beauty, and the blight on these,— Of all she is aware: luxuriant woods, Fresh, living, sunlit, in her dream she sees; And ever midst those verdant solitudes The soldier’s wooden cross, O’ergrown by creeping tendrils and rank moss. Was hers a dream of empire? was it sin? And is it well that all was borne in vain? She knows no more than one who slow doth win, After fierce fever, conscious life again, Too tired, too weak, too sad, By the new light to be or stirred or glad. From rich sea-islands fringing her green shore, From broad plantations where swart freemen bend Bronzed backs in willing labor, from her store Of golden fruit, from stream, from town, ascend Life-currents of pure health: Her aims shall be subserved with boundless wealth. Yet now how listless and how still she lies, Like some half-savage, dusky Indian queen, Rocked in her hammock ’neath her native skies, With the pathetic, passive, broken mien Of one who, sorely proved, Great-souled, hath suffered much and much hath loved! But look! along the wide-branched, dewy glade Glimmers the dawn: the light palmetto trees And cypresses reissue from the shade, And she hath wakened.

They seem to be reflecting on their wishes and expressing a particular preference for their final resting place. The phrase ""let no cemetery engulph me"" indicates that the speaker has a different vision or preference for their burial. It could imply a desire for a non-traditional burial, such as cremation or a different type of burial site, or it may reflect a wish to have their remains scattered or placed in a specific location. This statement highlights the significance of personal preferences and individuality, even in matters related to death and burial. People often have unique beliefs, cultural practices, or personal connections to certain places that influence their choices for afterlife arrangements. The phrase serves as a thought-provoking reflection on the diverse ways in which individuals express their final wishes and the importance of respecting those wishes as a way to honor and celebrate the uniqueness of each person's life journey.",1132,0,0,0,0,FALSE

Has left, like a friend that is true in the sun, And false in the shadows. He has found new delights, in the land where he's gone, Greener woodlands and meadows.

The uncles fell in, chuckling phony chuckles, What a good time she’ll have learning to swim! Back in my sisters’ room Mami was packing a hurried bag, allowing one toy apiece, her red eyes belying her explanation: a week at the beach so Papi can get some rest. She dressed us in our best dresses, party shoes. Something was off, I knew, but I was young and didn’t think adult things could go wrong. So as we quietly filed out of the house we wouldn’t see again for another decade, I let myself lie back in the deep waters, my arms out like Jesus’ on His cross, and instead of sinking down as I’d always done, magically, that night, I could stay up, floating out, past the driveway, past the gates, in the black Ford, Papi grim at the wheel, winding through back roads, stroke by difficult stroke, out on the highway, heading toward the coast. Past the checkpoint, we raced towards the airport, my sisters crying when we turned before the family beach house, Mami consoling, there was a better surprise in store for us! She couldn’t tell, though, until ... until we were there. But I had already swum ahead and guessed some loss much larger than I understood, more danger than the deep end of the pool. At the dark, deserted airport we waited. All night in a fitful sleep, I swam. At dawn the plane arrived, and as we boarded, Papi, you turned, your eyes scanned the horizon as if you were trying to sight a distant swimmer, your hand frantically waving her back in, for you knew as we stepped inside the cabin that a part of both of us had been set adrift. Weeks later, wandering our new city, hand in hand, you tried to explain the wonders: escalators as moving belts; elevators: pulleys and ropes; blond hair and blue eyes: a genetic code. We stopped before a summery display window at Macy’s, The World’s Largest Department Store, to admire a family outfitted for the beach: the handsome father, slim and sure of himself, so unlike you, Papi, with your thick mustache, your three-piece suit, your fedora hat, your accent. And by his side a girl who looked like Heidi in my storybook waded in colored plastic. We stood awhile, marveling at America, both of us trying hard to feel luckier than we felt, both of us pointing out the beach pails, the shovels, the sandcastles no wave would ever topple, the red and blue boats. And when we backed away, we saw our reflections superimposed, big-eyed, dressed too formally with all due respect as visitors to this country. Or like, Papi, two swimmers looking down at the quiet surface of our island waters, seeing their faces right before plunging in, eager, afraid, not yet sure of the outcome.",https://poemotopia.com/julia-alvarez/exile/,"I apologize, but as of my last update in September 2021, there is no known poem titled 'Exile' by Julia Alvarez.

""The night we fled the country, Papi, you told me we were going to the beach"" sets the scene of the departure, which appears to have been conducted secretly or discreetly, given the mention of fleeing. The use of the word ""night"" adds a sense of secrecy and urgency, as night journeys are often associated with covert actions. The mention of ""Papi"" signifies a deep and personal relationship between the speaker and their father, creating a touching and intimate dimension to the narrative. The phrase ""you told me we were going to the beach"" introduces an element of deception or concealment, as the father likely used this explanation as a cover story to protect the speaker from the harsh reality of the situation. It implies that the true purpose of the journey was something far more serious or perilous than a simple beach outing. This opening line holds an air of mystery and tension, leaving readers curious to know more about the circumstances that led to their escape and the emotional journey that unfolded thereafter. It suggests a tale of resilience, sacrifice, and the deep bond between a parent and child during challenging times. Such stories are often filled with courage, hope, and the pursuit of a better life.

After the initial presidential election results come in, I stop watching the news. I want to continue watching, charting, and discussing the counts, the recounts, the hand counts, but I can­not. I lose hope. However Bush came to have won, he would still be winning ten days later and we would still be in the throes of our American optimism. All the non-reporting is a distraction from Bush himself, the same Bush who can't remember if two or three people were convicted for dragging a black man to his death in his home state of Texas. / You don't remember because you don't care. Some­times my mother's voice swells and fills my forehead. Mostly I resist the flooding, but in Bush's case I find myself talking to the television screen: You don't know because you don't care. / Then, like all things impassioned, this voice takes on a life of its own: You don't know because you don't bloody care. Do you? / I forget things too. It makes me sad. Or it makes me the saddest. The sadness is not really about George W. or our American optimism; the sadness lives in the recog­nition that a life can not matter. Or, as there are billions of lives, my sadness is alive alongside the recognition that billions of lives never mattered. I write this with­out breaking my heart, without bursting into anything. Perhaps this is the real source of my sadness. Or, per­haps, Emily Dickinson, my love, hope was never a thing with feathers. I don't know, I just find when the news comes on I switch the channel. This new ten­dency might be indicative of a deepening personality flaw: IMH, The Inability to Maintain Hope, which trans­lates into no innate trust in the supreme laws that gov­ern us. Cornel West says this is what is wrong with black people today—too nihilistic.

Optimism is the belief that the odds are stacked in your favor. It’s the belief that you can access those odds through your will and power. But what if the odds are stacked against you? What if the odds are stacked against most of us? Hope, says West, is this: it’s an action that allows us to choose how we respond to the odds. To hope is to gamble. It’s to bet on the future, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite. It’s opposite the indifference that gets someone killed in trying to save a child because all that is said is, “I cannot imagine the world being different from the bad one that keeps trying to destroy you.” Hope is an acknowledgment that you can still be crushed but refuse to be broken.",1384,"Cornel West, a prominent American philosopher, social critic, and civil rights activist, has indeed made the point that hope is different from American optimism. In West's writings and speeches, he often emphasizes the distinction between hope and optimism, particularly in the context of American culture and society. While optimism tends to be characterized by a positive outlook, a belief in progress, and a sense of confidence in the future, hope, according to West, is a deeper and more profound concept. For West, hope is not simply a blind belief in better circumstances or an unwavering faith in progress. Instead, he sees hope as an active and transformative force that requires facing the harsh realities of life and society honestly. It involves acknowledging the challenges and injustices present in the world while maintaining a sense of possibility for positive change. In contrast, American optimism, according to West's critique, can sometimes be superficial or disconnected from the actual struggles and suffering experienced by marginalized communities. He calls for a more authentic form of hope that arises from a genuine engagement with the realities of inequality and injustice. West's perspective on hope and American optimism aligns with his broader critique of American society and its systems. He has been a vocal advocate for social justice, human rights, and the empowerment of marginalized communities. By highlighting the distinction between hope and American optimism, Cornel West invites individuals to critically examine the deeper social and political issues that affect society. He encourages people to embrace a more meaningful and transformative form of hope, one that inspires collective action and positive change for a more just and equitable world.",1446,0,0,0,0,FALSE

""There exists a wanting to escape"" expresses a yearning or longing to break free from the constraints, pressures, or challenges faced during those particular years. It might encompass a desire to seek solace, find a sense of freedom, or take a break from routine responsibilities. This opening line leaves room for readers to interpret the specifics of what one might want to escape from and what form the escape might take. It could refer to a need to escape the pressures of work, societal expectations, personal responsibilities, or even internal struggles. The sentence captures a universal experience, as many people have moments when they feel the urge to escape from the demands of everyday life. It reflects the human desire for moments of respite, rejuvenation, or a change of scenery to find balance and renewal. As the beginning of a larger piece or thought, this opening line sets a reflective and introspective tone, prompting readers to ponder their own experiences with the yearning to escape and what it might signify in their lives.

Occasionally, you can imagine, it means he is not going to make it to Carson City or Texas or somewhere else out west or to Mexico if he is on the run. On another level always implicit is the sense that it means he is not going to make it to his own death. Perhaps in the back of all our minds is the life expectancy for our generation. Perhaps this expectation lingers there alongside the hours of sleep one should get or the number of times one is meant to chew food—eight hours, twenty chews, and seventy-six years.

It was winter. It got dark early. The waiting room was full of grown-up people, arctics and overcoats, lamps and magazines. My aunt was inside what seemed like a long time and while I waited and read the National Geographic (I could read) and carefully studied the photographs: the inside of a volcano, black, and full of ashes; then it was spilling over in rivulets of fire. Osa and Martin Johnson dressed in riding breeches, laced boots, and pith helmets. A dead man slung on a pole --""Long Pig,"" the caption said. Babies with pointed heads wound round and round with string; black, naked women with necks wound round and round with wire like the necks of light bulbs. Their breasts were horrifying. I read it right straight through. I was too shy to stop. And then I looked at the cover: the yellow margins, the date. Suddenly, from inside, came an oh! of pain --Aunt Consuelo's voice-- not very loud or long. I wasn't at all surprised; even then I knew she was a foolish, timid woman. I might have been embarrassed, but wasn't. What took me completely by surprise was that it was me: my voice, in my mouth. Without thinking at all I was my foolish aunt, I--we--were falling, falling, our eyes glued to the cover of the National Geographic, February, 1918. I said to myself: three days and you'll be seven years old. I was saying it to stop the sensation of falling off the round, turning world. into cold, blue-black space. But I felt: you are an I, you are an Elizabeth, you are one of them. Why should you be one, too? I scarcely dared to look to see what it was I was. I gave a sidelong glance --I couldn't look any higher-- at shadowy gray knees, trousers and skirts and boots and different pairs of hands lying under the lamps. I knew that nothing stranger had ever happened, that nothing stranger could ever happen. Why should I be my aunt, or me, or anyone? What similarities-- boots, hands, the family voice I felt in my throat, or even the National Geographic and those awful hanging breasts-- held us all together or made us all just one? How--I didn't know any word for it--how ""unlikely"". . . How had I come to be here, like them, and overhear a cry of pain that could have got loud and worse but hadn't? The waiting room was bright and too hot. It was sliding beneath a big black wave, another, and another. Then I was back in it. The War was on.

""Isn't hard to master"" appears to contradict the common belief that dealing with loss is difficult or painful. By asserting that it is not hard to master, the line challenges conventional notions about the emotional difficulty of losing something or someone. In the context of the entire poem, Bishop goes on to discuss various aspects of loss and its gradual intensification. The poem becomes an exploration of the losses one encounters in life and how individuals may learn to navigate and cope with them. ""The art of losing isn't hard to master"" is a striking and thought-provoking opening that engages readers in a reflection on the complexities of loss, resilience, and the human experience. Throughout the poem, Bishop delves into the significance of small and significant losses, reminding readers that mastering the art of losing is a part of the human journey.",960,1,1,0,2,TRUE

",1,"The lines ""Sorrow like a ceaseless rain / Beats upon my heart"" create a vivid and poignant metaphor that conveys a deep and relentless emotional pain. The comparison of sorrow to a ""ceaseless rain"" suggests that the feeling of sadness is continuous and unending, much like rain that falls persistently without stopping. This imagery evokes a sense of heaviness and melancholy, as if the weight of sorrow is unrelenting. The phrase ""Beats upon my heart"" adds to the intensity of the emotion. The word ""beats"" implies that the sorrow strikes or pounds on the speaker's heart with force, emphasizing the emotional impact it has on their innermost feelings. The lines evoke a powerful sense of grief or heartache, expressing the emotional turmoil that the speaker is experiencing. The use of nature imagery to depict emotions is a common poetic device, allowing readers to connect with and understand the depth of the speaker's feelings. Overall, these lines create a haunting and evocative depiction of sorrow, capturing the overwhelming and unending nature of the speaker's emotional pain. It is a poignant expression of the human experience of grief and the profound impact it can have on the heart and soul.",955,0,1,0,1,TRUE

",5,"The opening line, ""What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,"" is from the sonnet ""What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why"" by Edna St. Vincent Millay. This line immediately draws the reader into a contemplative exploration of past experiences and memories. The line introduces a speaker who is reflecting on their romantic past, pondering the people they have kissed, the places where those kisses occurred, and the reasons behind those moments of intimacy. ""What lips my lips have kissed"" suggests that the speaker has had multiple romantic encounters, each represented by the act of kissing. The repetition of ""lips"" emphasizes the significance of this physical and emotional gesture in their life. ""and where"" prompts readers to imagine various settings or locations where these moments of intimacy took place. It opens up the possibility of diverse and meaningful experiences that may have occurred in different places and contexts. ""and why"" adds an introspective dimension to the line. The speaker contemplates the motivations or reasons behind these past romantic connections, leading to a deeper examination of their emotions and desires. This opening line sets the stage for a sonnet that delves into the memories of love and desire, inviting readers to explore the complexities of human relationships and the impact of past experiences on the speaker's present state of mind. Edna St. Vincent Millay's sonnet further unfolds with rich and evocative imagery, capturing the nostalgia, longing, and introspection that comes with reflecting on a romantic past.

So with my eyes I traced the line Of the horizon, thin and fine, Straight around till I was come Back to where I'd started from; And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood. Over these things I could not see; These were the things that bounded me; And I could touch them with my hand, Almost, I thought, from where I stand. And all at once things seemed so small My breath came short, and scarce at all. But, sure, the sky is big, I said; Miles and miles above my head; So here upon my back I'll lie And look my fill into the sky. And so I looked, and, after all, The sky was not so very tall. The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, And—sure enough!—I see the top! The sky, I thought, is not so grand; I 'most could touch it with my hand! And reaching up my hand to try, I screamed to feel it touch the sky. I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity Came down and settled over me; Forced back my scream into my chest, Bent back my arm upon my breast, And, pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind, Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold; Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around, And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres, The creaking of the tented sky, The ticking of Eternity. I saw and heard, and knew at last The How and Why of all things, past, And present, and forevermore. The Universe, cleft to the core, Lay open to my probing sense That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence But could not,—nay! But needs must suck At the great wound, and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn! For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul. All sin was of my sinning, all Atoning mine, and mine the gall Of all regret. Mine was the weight Of every brooded wrong, the hate That stood behind each envious thrust, Mine every greed, mine every lust. And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,— Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,—then mourned for all! A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat. No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God. Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die. Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,—there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust. Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead. And all at once, and over all The pitying rain began to fall; I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly, thatched roof, And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before. For rain it hath a friendly sound To one who's six feet underground; And scarce the friendly voice or face: A grave is such a quiet place. The rain, I said, is kind to come And speak to me in my new home. I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain, To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line, To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping apple-trees. For soon the shower will be done, And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously, and each round drop Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top. How can I bear it; buried here, While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm? O, multi-colored, multiform, Beloved beauty over me, That I shall never, never see Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, That I shall never more behold! Sleeping your myriad magics through, Close-sepulchred away from you! O God, I cried, give me new birth, And put me back upon the earth! Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain, down-poured In one big torrent, set me free, Washing my grave away from me! I ceased; and through the breathless hush That answered me, the far-off rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer, and—crash! Before the wild wind's whistling lash The startled storm-clouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky, And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave. I know not how such things can be; I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things; A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself, And, through and over everything, A sense of glad awakening. The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, Whispering to me I could hear; I felt the rain's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips, Laid gently on my sealed sight, And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see,— A drenched and dripping apple-tree, A last long line of silver rain, A sky grown clear and blue again. And as I looked a quickening gust Of wind blew up to me and thrust Into my face a miracle Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,— I know not how such things can be!— I breathed my soul back into me. Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I And hailed the earth with such a cry As is not heard save from a man Who has been dead, and lives again. About the trees my arms I wound; Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; I raised my quivering arms on high; I laughed and laughed into the sky, Till at my throat a strangling sob Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb Sent instant tears into my eyes; O God, I cried, no dark disguise Can e'er hereafter hide from me Thy radiant identity! Thou canst not move across the grass But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, Nor speak, however silently, But my hushed voice will answer Thee. I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day; God, I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart! The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide; Above the world is stretched the sky,— No higher than the soul is high. The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand; The soul can split the sky in two, And let the face of God shine through. But East and West will pinch the heart That can not keep them pushed apart; And he whose soul is flat—the sky Will cave in on him by and by.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55993/renascence,"All I could see from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood; I turned and looked another way, And saw three islands in a bay.

The phrase ""I am not resigned"" conveys a strong refusal to accept or yield to a particular fate or circumstance. It suggests a firm determination to resist the idea of accepting loss and grief passively. ""the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground"" symbolizes the burial of loved ones after death. The phrase conveys the harsh and final reality of death, as the bodies of those who were once alive and loved are laid to rest in the unforgiving earth. By saying they are ""not resigned,"" the speaker implies that they refuse to accept the conventional notions of loss and separation that come with death. They are grappling with the profound pain of losing loved ones and expressing their resistance to the idea of permanently parting with them. The line captures the universal struggle with mortality and the desire to hold on to the memories and connections with those who have passed away. It speaks to the human longing for permanence and a deep-seated refusal to say goodbye to cherished loved ones.

As people age, it is natural that they will experience the loss of friends and loved ones. This can occur for various reasons, including illness, aging, or other life circumstances. The phrase ""leave us behind"" suggests that as time goes on, some friends may pass away, and the living must continue without them. The statement highlights the bittersweet reality of life—the joy of forming connections with others and the sadness of eventually having to say goodbye. As individuals grow older, they may face increasing losses in their social circles, and the feeling of losing companions and loved ones can be profound. The passage of time and the experience of loss can prompt individuals to reflect on the value of relationships and the importance of cherishing moments with friends and loved ones while they are still present. It can also lead to contemplation about mortality and the impermanence of life. Ultimately, the statement conveys a universal truth about the human experience—the inevitability of change and the transient nature of human connections.

It captures a key aspect of Ginsberg's creative philosophy and approach to writing. ""First thought"" refers to the initial, spontaneous ideas that arise in a writer's mind. It suggests the unfiltered, raw, and intuitive expressions that emerge before the mind has a chance to overthink or censor itself. ""Best thought"" implies that these initial ideas, when expressed without hesitation or self-censorship, often have a certain authenticity and power that can be lost or diluted when subjected to overthinking or excessive editing. Ginsberg's advocacy for ""First thought, Best thought"" encourages writers to trust their instincts and embrace the immediacy and freshness of their initial ideas. He believed that by capturing and preserving the spontaneity of the first thoughts, writers could tap into a deeper level of truth and creativity. This approach aligns with the Beat Generation's ethos of valuing personal experience, authenticity, and the rejection of societal conventions. Ginsberg and other Beat poets sought to break free from conventional poetic forms and to explore more liberated and uninhibited styles of expression. ""First thought, Best thought"" has become a celebrated mantra for writers and artists, reminding them to stay connected to their creative instincts and to embrace the raw and unfiltered essence of their work. It encourages writers to trust their creative impulses and resist the temptation to overanalyze or censor their expressions, thereby allowing for more genuine and impactful artistic creations.",1449,0,0,0,0,FALSE

The marina might represent a place of human activity and the intersection of nature and civilization. The phrase as a whole paints a vivid picture of the crow's solitary flight amidst a somber and overcast sky. The imagery evokes a sense of melancholy or solitude, as the crow's call and arching flight stand in contrast to the heaviness of the sky and the bustling marina below. The line's poetic language and use of personification create an emotional connection between the reader and the natural world. It encourages readers to appreciate the beauty and significance of simple moments in nature and to find meaning in the interactions between humans and the environment.",974,1,0,0,1,TRUE

The phrase invokes the idea of an ""earth spirit,"" which can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the natural world or the environment. In various cultures and belief systems, the earth is often personified as a spirit or deity, embodying the essence of nature and its elements. The use of ""who lives here"" suggests that the earth spirit is present and connected to a specific location or place, perhaps implying that the speaker is in a natural setting such as a forest, a grove, a meadow, or any other place where the spirit is believed to reside. The sentence can be seen as a call for respect and mindfulness toward nature and the environment. It encourages people to approach natural spaces with reverence and consideration, acknowledging the inherent value of the earth spirit and recognizing the interconnectedness between humans and the natural world.

She hears the stars gossip with the sun, sees the moon washing her lean darkness with water electrified by prayers. All over the world there are those who can't sleep, those who never awaken. My granddaughter sleeps on the breast of her mother with milk on her mouth. A fly contemplates the sweetness of lactose. Her father is wrapped in the blanket of nightmares. For safety he approaches the red hills near Thoreau. They recognize him and sing for him. Her mother has business in the house of chaos. She is a prophet dis- guised as a young mother who is looking for a job. She appears at the door of my dreams and we put the house back together. Panther watches as human and animal souls are lifted to the heavens by rain clouds to partake of songs of beautiful thunder. Others are led by deer and antelope in the wistful hours to the vil- lages of their ancestors. There they eat cornmeal cooked with berries that stain their lips with purple while the tree of life flickers in the sun. It's October, though the season before dawn is always winter. On the city streets of this desert town lit by chemical yellow travelers search for home. Some have been drinking and intimate with strangers. Others are escapees from the night shift, sip lukewarm coffee, shift gears to the other side of darkness. One woman stops at a red light, turns over a worn tape to the last chorus of a whispery blues. She has decided to live another day. The stars take notice, as do the half-asleep flowers, prickly pear and chinaberry tree who drink exhaust into their roots, into the earth. She guns the light to home where her children are asleep and may never know she ever left. That their fate took a turn in the land of nightmares toward the sun may be untouchable knowledge. It is a sweet sound. The panther relative yawns and puts her head between her paws. She dreams of the house of panthers and the seven steps to grace.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47719/insomnia-and-the-seven-steps-to-grace,"I apologize, but as of my last update in September 2021, there is no known poem titled 'Insomnia and the Seven Steps to Grace' by Joy Harjo.

To meet this stream a flow'ret came, And kindling in the solar beam, With glowing warmth and mantling flame Did with the waves contend and stream. The stream, to check its fond desire, Address'd the nymph with gentle breeze, And asked what fatal cause of fire Possess'd her blooming charms to please.

With every grin, he spreads delight, Chasing away the darkest night. Yet, behind the mask and painted grin, Lies more than humor deep within. A soul that's felt both joy and pain, He weaves emotions through his vein. Though often clad in fun and play, He too knows tears on a rainy day.

I own indeed, that generous mind That weeps the woes of human kind, That heart by friendship's charms inspired, That soul with sprightly fancy fired, The air of life, the vivid eye, The flowing wit, the keen reply— To paint these beauties as they shine, Might ask a nobler pen than mine. Yet what sure strokes can draw the Fair, Who vary, like the fleeting air, Like willows bending to the force, Where'er the gales direct their course, Opposed to no misfortune's power, And changing with the changing hour. Now gaily sporting on the plain, They charm the grove with pleasing strain; Anon disturb'd, they know not why, The sad tear trembles in their eye: Led through vain life's uncertain dance, The dupes of whim, the slaves of chance. From me, not famed for much goodnature, Expect not compliment, but satire; To draw your picture quite unable, Instead of fact accept a Fable. One morn, in Æsop's noisy time, When all things talk'd, and talk'd in rhyme, A cloud exhaled by vernal beams Rose curling o'er the glassy streams. The dawn her orient blushes spread, And tinged its lucid skirts with red, Wide waved its folds with glitt'ring dies, And gaily streak'd the eastern skies; Beneath, illumed with rising day, The sea's broad mirror floating lay. Pleased, o'er the wave it hung in air, Survey'd its glittering glories there, And fancied, dress'd in gorgeous show, Itself the brightest thing below: For clouds could raise the vaunting strain, And not the fair alone were vain. Yet well it knew, howe'er array'd, That beauty, e'en in clouds, might fade, That nothing sure its charms could boast Above the loveliest earthly toast; And so, like them, in early dawn Resolved its picture should be drawn, That when old age with length'ning day Should brush the vivid rose away, The world should from the portrait own Beyond all clouds how bright it shone. Hard by, a painter raised his stage, Far famed, the Copley[1] of his age. So just a form his colours drew, Each eye the perfect semblance knew; Yet still on every blooming face He pour'd the pencil's flowing grace; Each critic praised the artist rare, Who drew so like, and yet so fair. To him, high floating in the sky Th' elated Cloud advanced t' apply. The painter soon his colours brought, The Cloud then sat, the artist wrought; Survey'd her form, with flatt'ring strictures, Just as when ladies sit for pictures, Declared ""whatever art can do, My utmost skill shall try for you: But sure those strong and golden dies Dipp'd in the radiance of the skies, Those folds of gay celestial dress, No mortal colours can express. Not spread triumphal o'er the plain, The rainbow boasts so fair a train, Nor e'en the morning sun so bright, Who robes his face in heav'nly light. To view that form of angel make, Again Ixion would mistake, And justly deem so fair a prize, The sovereign Mistress of the skies,"" He said, and drew a mazy line, With crimson touch his pencils shine, The mingling colours sweetly fade, And justly temper light and shade. He look'd; the swelling Cloud on high With wider circuit spread the sky, Stretch'd to the sun an ampler train, And pour'd new glories on the main. As quick, effacing every ground, His pencil swept the canvas round, And o'er its field, with magic art, Call'd forth new forms in every part. But now the sun, with rising ray, Advanced with speed his early way; Each colour takes a differing die, The orange glows, the purples fly. The artist views the alter'd sight, And varies with the varying light; In vain! a sudden gust arose, New folds ascend, new shades disclose, And sailing on with swifter pace, The Cloud displays another face. In vain the painter, vex'd at heart, Tried all the wonders of his art; In vain he begg'd, her form to grace, One moment she would keep her place: For, ""changing thus with every gale, Now gay with light, with gloom now pale, Now high in air with gorgeous train, Now settling on the darken'd main, With looks more various than the moon; A French coquette were drawn as soon."" He spoke; again the air was mild, The Cloud with opening radiance smiled; With canvas new his art he tries, Anew he joins the glitt'ring dies; Th' admiring Cloud with pride beheld Her image deck the pictured field, And colours half-complete adorn The splendor of the painted morn. When lo, the stormy winds arise, Deep gloom invests the changing skies; The sounding tempest shakes the plain, And lifts in billowy surge the main. The Cloud's gay dies in darkness fade, Its folds condense in thicker shade, And borne by rushing blasts, its form With lowering vapour joins the storm.",https://allpoetry.com/John-Trumbull,"To thee, fair Freedom!

The Muses, who his lineage claim, Who from his great forefather came, Have only two fair ways to choose; To sing his virtue, or their Muse. But Phoebus smiled with decent pride, And to the sighing goddess cried ""Sing, heavenly maid, the king of kings; His virtue to th' admiring earth In ev'ry peaceful art make known, And sing his warrior's birth."" The virgin blushed, and bowed her head, And, blushing, thus reluctant said, ""Yet tell, O tell, celestial guide, My verse can never reach his pride."" ""Princes,"" says Phoebus, ""must not hear Their slightest faults revealed too clear. The Muses should be coy and hard, Nor ever yield their full reward.""

Each stock or stone could prate and gabble, Worse than ten labourers of Babel. Along the street, perhaps you'd see A Post disputing with a Tree, And mid their arguments of weight, A Goose sit umpire of debate. Each Dog you met, though speechless now, Would make his compliments and bow, And every Swine with congees come, To know how did all friends at home. Each Block sublime could make a speech, In style and eloquence as rich, And could pronounce it and could pen it, As well as Chatham in the senate. Nor prose alone.—In these young times, Each field was fruitful too in rhymes; Each feather'd minstrel felt the passion, And every wind breathed inspiration. Each Bullfrog croak'd in loud bombastic, Each Monkey chatter'd Hudibrastic; Each Cur, endued with yelping nature, Could outbark Churchill's self in satire; Each Crow in prophecy delighted, Each Owl, you saw, was second-sighted, Each Goose a skilful politician, Each Ass a gifted met'physician, Could preach in wrath 'gainst laughing rogues, Write Halfway-covenant Dialogues, And wisely judge of all disputes In commonwealths of men or brutes. 'Twas then, in spring a youthful Sparrow Felt the keen force of Cupid's arrow: For Birds, as Æsop's tales avow, Made love then, just as men do now, And talk'd of deaths and flames and darts, And breaking necks and losing hearts; And chose from all th' aerial kind, Not then to tribes, like Jews, confined The story tells, a lovely Thrush Had smit him from a neigh'bring bush, Where oft the young coquette would play, And carol sweet her siren lay: She thrill'd each feather'd heart with love, And reign'd the Toast of all the grove. He felt the pain, but did not dare Disclose his passion to the fair; For much he fear'd her conscious pride Of race, to noble blood allied. Her grandsire's nest conspicuous stood, Mid loftiest branches of the wood, In airy height, that scorn'd to know Each flitting wing that waved below. So doubting, on a point so nice He deem'd it best to take advice. Hard by there dwelt an aged Owl, Of all his friends the gravest fowl; Who from the cares of business free, Lived, hermit, in a hollow tree; To solid learning bent his mind, In trope and syllogism he shined, 'Gainst reigning follies spent his railing; Too much a Stoic—'twas his failing. Hither for aid our Sparrow came, And told his errand and his name, With panting breath explain'd his case, Much trembling at the sage's face; And begg'd his Owlship would declare If love were worth a wise one's care. The grave Owl heard the weighty cause, And humm'd and hah'd at every pause; Then fix'd his looks in sapient plan, Stretch'd forth one foot, and thus began. ""My son, my son, of love beware, And shun the cheat of beauty's snare; That snare more dreadful to be in, Than huntsman's net, or horse-hair gin. ""By others' harms learn to be wise,"" As ancient proverbs well advise. Each villany, that nature breeds, From females and from love proceeds. 'Tis love disturbs with fell debate Of man and beast the peaceful state: Men fill the world with war's alarms, When female trumpets sound to arms; The commonwealth of dogs delight For beauties, as for bones, to fight. Love hath his tens of thousands slain, And heap'd with copious death the plain: Samson, with ass's jaw to aid, Ne'er peopled thus th'infernal shade. ""Nor this the worst; for he that's dead, With love no more will vex his head. 'Tis in the rolls of fate above, That death's a certain cure for love; A noose can end the cruel smart; The lover's leap is from a cart. But oft a living death they bear, Scorn'd by the proud, capricious fair. The fair to sense pay no regard, And beauty is the fop's reward; They slight the generous hearts' esteem, And sigh for those, who fly from them. Just when your wishes would prevail, Some rival bird with gayer tail, Who sings his strain with sprightlier note, And chatters praise with livelier throat, Shall charm your flutt'ring fair one down, And leave your choice, to hang or drown. Ev'n I, my son, have felt the smart; A Pheasant won my youthful heart. For her I tuned the doleful lay, For her I watch'd the night away; In vain I told my piteous case, And smooth'd my dignity of face; In vain I cull'd the studied phrase, And sought hard words in beauty's praise. Her, not my charms nor sense could move, For folly is the food of love. Each female scorns our serious make, ""Each woman is at heart a rake.""

While my slow steps thus wound along the glade, I meditated on the tales he told; For, by his side, though there unseen, there walked A spirit, that inspired me with the thought, And to a verse involuntary turned His legend. But these shells to you I send, That you at leisure may peruse his tales Of soldiers, heroes, Christians, Saracens, Almansor, Godfredo, and Armida fair.

With the shells, Receive the wishes of the mountain bard.",2027,"Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remote And inaccessible by Shepherds trod, In a deep cave, dug by no mortals hands, A Hermit lived; a melancholy man, Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains. Austere and lonely, cruel to himself, Did they report him; the cold earth his bed, Water his drink, his food the shepherds alms. I went to see him, and my heart was touched With reverence and with pity. Mild he spake, And entering on discourse, such stories told As made me oft revisit his sad cell. For he had been a soldier in his youth; And fought in famous battles, when the peers Of Europe, by the bold Godfredo led, Against th' usurping infidels, displayed The blessed Cross, and won the Holy Land. Pleasure (he said) or wealth, no more shall tempt His course, or draw him from the cave of peace. Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to th' world, nor in broad rumour lies: But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes, And perfect witness of all-judging Jove; As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in heav'n expect thy meed. O fountain Arethuse, and thou honored flood, Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds, That strain I heard was of a higher mood! But now my oat proceeds, And listens to the Herald of the Sea That came in Neptune's plea; He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds, What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain? And questioned every gust of rugged wings That blows from off each beaked promontory: They knew not of his story; And sage Hippotades their answer brings, That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed: The air was calm, and on the level brine Sleek Panope with all her sisters played. It was that fatal and perfidious bark, Built in th' eclipse, and rigged with curses dark, That sunk so low that sacred head of thine. Next, Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow, His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe. Ah! Who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge? Last came, and last did go, The Pilot of the Galilean lake; Two massy keys he bore of metals twain (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake: How well could I have spared for thee, young swain, Enow of such as for their bellies' sake, Creep and intrude and climb into the fold! Of other care they little reck'ning make Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast, And shove away the worthy bidden guest. Blind mouths! That scarce themselves know how to hold A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least That to the faithful herdman's art belongs! What recks it them? What need they? They are sped; And when they list, their lean and flashy songs Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw: The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed; But swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread. Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw Daily devours apace, and nothing said, But that two-handed engine at the door Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more. Return, Alpheus, the dread voice is past That shrunk thy streams; return Sicilian Muse, And call the vales, and bid them hither cast Their bells and flowrets of a thousand hues. Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks On whose fresh lap the swart-star sparely looks; Throw hither all your quaint enameled eyes That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers, And purple all the ground with vernal flowers. Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet, The glowing violet, The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine, With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, And every flower that sad embroidery wears: Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed, And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, To strow the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. For so to interpose a little ease, Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise: Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled, Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world; Or whether thou to our moist vows denied, Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old, Where the great Vision of the guarded Mount Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold; Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth: And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth. Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. So sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed, And yet anon repairs his drooping head, And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high, Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves Where other groves and other streams along, With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. There entertain him all the saints above, In solemn troops, and sweet societies That sing, and singing in their glory move, And wipe the tears forever from his eyes. Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more; Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore, In thy large recompense, and shalt be good To all that wander in that perilous flood. Thus sang the uncouth swain to th' oaks and rills, While the still morn went out with sandals gray. He touched the tender stops of various quills",5103,"Lies a hidden place, unknown to most, Beneath a mountain's brow, almost forgot. Inaccessible, by shepherds trod, A sanctuary where nature nods. No easy path leads to this abode, A rugged journey down a rocky road. Yet, in this solitude, one may find, A world of wonder for the heart and mind. Untouched by man's intrusive hand, A wilderness of beauty, grand. The air is pure, the waters clear, A paradise far from human fear. Majestic trees, their branches tall, Stand guard within this sacred hall. Their leaves a canopy overhead, Where light and shadows gently thread. Wild creatures roam, both fierce and meek, In harmony with nature's mystique. The silence speaks in whispered tones, Of secrets kept, of ancient stones. The shepherds, too, may never know, This hidden realm where wonders grow. For only those with seeking eyes, Shall glimpse the treasure that belies. Beneath a mountain's brow, it lies, A realm of dreams 'neath open skies. A place where solitude finds grace, In nature's arms, a hallowed space.",730,0,0,0,0,FALSE

O Grief! thou never yet hast taught A breast of feeble frame To wrestle with the severing thought, And triumph o'er its flame. But I have known the hour of pride, When friends were round my seat, When I had power to quell the tide Of sighs that else had beat.

O for the flowers, the flowers of spring, The odour and the bloom; They may thy latent influence bring And chase away the gloom.

Or has the grubbing swine, by furies led, The enclosure broke, and on my flowrets fed? Ah me! that spot with blooms so lately grac'd, With storms and driving snows, is now defaced; Sharp icicles from every bush depend, And frosts all dazzling o'er the beds extend: Yet soon fair spring shall give another scene, And yellow cowslips gild the level green; My little orchard sprouting at each bough, Fragrant with clustering blossoms deep shall glow: Ah! then 't is sweet the tufted grass to tread, But sweeter slumbering is the balmy shade; The rapid humming-bird, with ruby breast, Seeks the parterre with early blue-bells drest, Drinks deep the honeysuckle dew, or drives The labouring bee to her domestic hives: Then shines the lupine bright with morning gems, And sleepy poppies nod upon their stems; The humble violet, and the dulcet rose, The stately lily then, and tulip blows.

What groan burst from Bain, when he saw that bright dome, Where childhood had sported, in ruins laid low! When, from friendship and kindred, so many had flown! Those dear to his heart who remained were in woe. In a frenzy of passion he knelt on the ground, And clasping his hands, to the tempest he cried, ""Come, lightning! Come, thunder! Come, tempests of heaven! But spare, oh! In mercy, my father, my bride! Must Erin forsake thee, by anguish compelled, Her mildew and ruin by traitors beheld? Ah! Country of kindred, of friendship, and love! My sorrows are thine, for thy children I mourn; And all the reward my misfortunes shall prove Will be thy derision, thy scoff, and thy scorn. From thee I am severed! Yet ne'er from my heart, By absence or sorrow, thy image shall part; And when, all deserted, I wander forlorn, In the land of the stranger, unpitied, alone, Still, Erin, thy beauty, thy grandeur, I'll mourn, And think of the friends I have there left behind, And think of the scenes that have faded away, Till pity shall soften this heart, unsubdued, And in tears of affection my sorrows be drowned.""

For when with the charms of the fair he is pressed, Some look, like the semblance of her he loves best, Shall waken remembrance, and sighs intervene; A tear shall steal down, and he'll turn from the scene. If heaven should pity the griefs of his heart, His sorrows would melt in the sunbeam of joy; For dearly he loved, and his youthful friend's part Was formed in the shade, nor to vary, destroy. With sorrow he left the fair haunts of his youth; He left, but he sighed as he gazed on the scene; ""Adieu, happy cottage! Where pleasure and truth With peace and contentment have ever been seen. A heart more sincere, or more tender, than thine, Has seldom existed on earth's narrow line. Ye pinks that I reared, and ye roses so fair, Sweet objects of care, all your beauties are fled; Yet dear to my heart, every thorn that is there, And dear to my heart is the spot where ye bled.""

The flowers bloom in colors bright, A floral tapestry of pure delight. The oceans wear a robe of blue, A vast expanse, a stunning view. Mountains rise with snowy capes, A majestic sight, their beauty drapes. Each season brings a different attire, A symphony of colors to admire.

He said to his friend, “If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night, Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,— One if by land, and two if by sea; And I on the opposite shore will be, Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm, For the country-folk to be up and to arm.” Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore, Just as the moon rose over the bay, Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset, British man-of-war: A phantom ship, with each mast and spar Across the moon, like a prison-bar, And a huge black hulk, that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide. Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street Wanders and watches with eager ears, Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door, The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, And the measured tread of the grenadiers Marching down to their boats on the shore. Then he climbed to the tower of the church, Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread, To the belfry-chamber overhead, And startled the pigeons from their perch On the sombre rafters, that round him made Masses and moving shapes of shade,— By the trembling ladder, steep and tall, To the highest window in the wall, Where he paused to listen and look down A moment on the roofs of the town, And the moonlight flowing over all. Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, In their night-encampment on the hill, Wrapped in silence so deep and still That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread, The watchful night-wind, as it went Creeping along from tent to tent, And seeming to whisper, “All is well!” A moment only he feels the spell Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread Of the lonely belfry and the dead; For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away, Where the river widens to meet the bay,— A line of black, that bends and floats On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. Now he patted his horse’s side, Now gazed on the landscape far and near, Then impetuous stamped the earth, And turned and tightened his saddle-girth; But mostly he watched with eager search The belfry-tower of the old North Church, As it rose above the graves on the hill, Lonely and spectral and sombre and still. And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height, A glimmer, and then a gleam of light! He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight A second lamp in the belfry burns! A hurry of hoofs in a village-street, A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet: That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light, The fate of a nation was riding that night; And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, Kindled the land into flame with its heat.

It was twelve by the village clock When he crossed the bridge into Medford town. He heard the crowing of the cock, And the barking of the farmer’s dog, And felt the damp of the river-fog, That rises when the sun goes down. It was one by the village clock, When he galloped into Lexington. He saw the gilded weathercock Swim in the moonlight as he passed, And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, Gaze at him with a spectral glare, As if they already stood aghast At the bloody work they would look upon. It was two by the village clock, When he came to the bridge in Concord town. He heard the bleating of the flock, And the twitter of birds among the trees, And felt the breath of the morning breeze Blowing over the meadows brown. And one was safe and asleep in his bed Who at the bridge would be first to fall, Who that day would be lying dead, Pierced by a British musket-ball. You know the rest. In the books you have read, How the British Regulars fired and fled,— How the farmers gave them ball for ball, From behind each fence and farmyard-wall, Chasing the red-coats down the lane, Then crossing the fields to emerge again Under the trees at the turn of the road, And only pausing to fire and load. So through the night rode Paul Revere; And so through the night went his cry of alarm To every Middlesex village and farm,— A cry of defiance, and not of fear, A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door, And a word that shall echo forevermore!

He said to his friend, ""If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night, Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch Of the North Church tower as a signal light, — One, if by land, and two, if by sea; And I on the opposite shore will be, Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm, For the country-folk to be up and to arm."" Then he said, ""Good-night!"" and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore, Just as the moon rose over the bay, Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset, British man-of-war; A phantom ship, with each mast and spar Across the moon like a prison bar, And a huge black hulk, that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide. Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street, Wanders and watches with eager ears, Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door, The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, And the measured tread of the grenadiers, Marching down to their boats on the shore. Then he climbed to the tower of the church, Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread, To the belfry-chamber overhead, And startled the pigeons from their perch On the sombre rafters, that round him made Masses and moving shapes of shade, — By the trembling ladder, steep and tall, To the highest window in the wall, Where he paused to listen and look down A moment on the roofs of the town, And the moonlight flowing over all. Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, In their night-encampment on the hill, Wrapped in silence so deep and still That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread, The watchful night-wind, as it went Creeping along from tent to tent, And seeming to whisper, ""All is well!"" A moment only he feels the spell Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread Of the lonely belfry and the dead; For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away, Where the river widens to meet the bay, — A line of black that bends and floats On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. Now he patted his horse's side, Now gazed on the landscape far and near, Then, impetuous, stamped the earth, And turned and tightened his saddle-girth; But mostly he watched with eager search The belfry-tower of the old North Church, As it rose above the graves on the hill, Lonely, and spectral, and sombre, and still.

The raging sea did not relent, Its fury would not cease. But through the night, the Hesperus fought, In search of a safe release. And as the morning sun arose, The storm began to wane.

The lines you provided are from a poem titled ""The Incurable"" by Charles Churchill, not Philip Freneau. Here is the full text of ""The Incurable"" by Charles Churchill: A Picture from the Life To serve with love, And shed your blood, Approved may be above, But here below (Example shew,) 'Tis dangerous to be good. —Lord Oxford Deep in a vale, a stranger now to arms, Too poor to shine in courts, too proud to beg, He rests his musing head upon his hand, And rolls his eye-balls o'er the fabled deeds Of ancient heroes, unenslaved by vice, Who conquered Nature, and who govern'd Man. Oft as the sun peeps o'er yon eastern hill, Fair to the day he weeps the deed of night; And when the sun declines, the tear again Steals o'er the good man's cheek; he drops a tear In thinking of the brave—how he might be. Ha! what's this object that obstructs the light, And seems to blink at yonder rising orb? A Tear, perhaps a curse. Man wants but this To make him wretched. Tear succeeds to tear; New sorrows pour, and join the old. He thinks Or seems to think (for the dull empty brain Is soft and yielding as the Thames's mud When one who never deep in plough'd it, treads), That a foul fiend has occupied his breast, And made the cell of his rapt soul a hell. Then, at himself he trembling flies, and meets Aghast, the torturer there. He sees a fiend, And starts to find his enemy himself. But is this picture true, or do I dream? Seest thou, my soul, a pleasing vision here, Or is it all a cloud, an air-built dream Of Phantasy? Come, we will sleep again. —'Twas but a picture of the man we wish. Wise he reveres himself; 'tis fit he should: We wish to be, and to be still the same. Why is the silly, fondling world to man Averse to sober thought, and eager still To crown the man of folly? Why to him Is high applause the stimulus to scorn? That man who mourns for virtue, and condemns Her votaries, with us let him remain, Still in the vale of folly. Wisdom hails Man to his native skies, his station there, His proper station, his right sphere to fill. Vain is the world's applause to Virtue's sons: They seek reward superior. They defy The praise of finery and dress, and make The body's finish but a trifling care. The soul is the man's self. He lifts himself Above this mundane ball, and looks on earth, What time and place they limit, all, as lost; He views in prospect all the range of time, Time past, time present, and time yet to come. His eye grows wide, and every thought is low. In vain would fools still trample Virtue's sons, For Virtue's sons are Lords of human race. They spread the glittering plumes, and soar to heav'n. Survey the globe and see a hundred crowds Of men. You'll find a hundred fools, for one In search of sense. What wonder then that Fools Are most men's idols, and their shrine, their God?",2209,"Deep in a vale, a stranger now to arms, A peaceful scene, untouched by war's alarms. A picture from the life, where love does thrive, A place where good intentions come alive. To serve with love, a noble act indeed, To offer help to those in need. And shed your blood, if duty calls, A sacrifice that breaks down walls. Approved may be above, in heaven's gaze, Where virtue's light forever stays. But here below, on earthly ground, Virtue's path may not be always sound. Example show, the caution rings, For good intentions wear two wings. In this world, where dangers hide, Being kind and true, we must decide. Lord Oxford's words, a timely guide, In goodness' journey, we must confide. To navigate this earthly plane, With love and wisdom, we remain. So in that vale, where peace does bloom, Let kindness lead, dispelling gloom.

Who straightway peeped out of the shell To view the world beyond, Longing at once to sally forth And paddle in the pond. ""Oh! be not rash,"" her father said, A mild Socratic bird; Her mother begged her not to stray With many a warning word. But little goosey was perverse, And eagerly did cry, ""I've got a lovely pair of wings, Of course I ought to fly."" In vain parental cacklings, In vain the cold sky's frown, Ambitious goosey tried to soar, But always tumbled down. The farmyard jeered at her attempts, The peacocks screamed, ""Oh fie! You're only a domestic goose, So don't pretend to fly."" Great cock-a-doodle from his perch Crowed daily loud and clear, ""Stay in the puddle, foolish bird, That is your proper sphere,"" The ducks and hens said, one and all, In gossip by the pool, ""Our children never play such pranks; My dear, that fowl's a fool."" The owls came out and flew about, Hooting above the rest, ""No useful egg was ever hatched From transcendental nest."" Good little goslings at their play And well-conducted chicks Were taught to think poor goosey's flights Were naughty, ill-bred tricks. They were content to swim and scratch, And not at all inclined For any wild goose chase in search Of something undefined. Hard times she had as one may guess, That young aspiring bird, Who still from every fall arose Saddened but undeterred. She knew she was no nightingale Yet spite of much abuse, She longed to help and cheer the world, Although a plain gray goose She could not sing, she could not fly, Nor even walk, with grace, And all the farmyard had declared A puddle was her place. But something stronger than herself Would cry, ""Go on, go on! Remember, though an humble fowl, You're cousin to a swan."" So up and down poor goosey went, A busy, hopeful bird. Searched many wide unfruitful fields, And many waters stirred. At length she came unto a stream Most fertile of all Niles, Where tuneful birds might soar and sing Among the leafy isles. Here did she build a little nest Beside the waters still, Where the parental goose could rest Unvexed by any bill. And here she paused to smooth her plumes, Ruffled by many plagues; When suddenly arose the cry, ""This goose lays golden eggs."" At once the farmyard was agog; The ducks began to quack; Prim Guinea fowls relenting called, ""Come back, come back, come back."" Great chanticleer was pleased to give A patronizing crow, And the contemptuous biddies clucked, ""I wish my chicks did so."" The peacocks spread their shining tails, And cried in accents soft, ""We want to know you, gifted one, Come up and sit aloft."" Wise owls awoke and gravely said, With proudly swelling breasts, ""Rare birds have always been evoked From transcendental nests!"" News-hunting turkeys from afar Now ran with all thin legs To gobble facts and fictions of The goose with golden eggs. But best of all the little fowls Still playing on the shore, Soft downy chicks and goslings gay, Chirped out, ""Dear Goose, lay more."" But goosey all these weary years Had toiled like any ant, And wearied out she now replied ""My little dears, I can't. ""When I was starving, half this corn Had been of vital use, Now I am surfeited with food Like any Strasbourg goose."" So to escape too many friends, Without uncivil strife, She ran to the Atlantic pond And paddled for her life. Soon up among the grand old Alps She found two blessed things, The health she had so nearly lost, And rest for weary limbs. But still across the briny deep Couched in most friendly words, Came prayers for letters, tales, or verse From literary birds.

And with a mix of wheat and corn, She fed her little one, But he grew too fat, and so was killed The last of November morn. Then on the twenty-fifth of December, This turkey, stuffed with sage, And onion sauce and cranberry, Furnished a Christmas page.

The farmer's eyes beheld the bird, And saw a feast in sight, A centerpiece for Thanksgiving Day, A culinary delight. But little did they comprehend, The turkey's silent plea, To be spared from the dinner plate, To roam and live life free. In vain, the turkey strutted round, Displaying grandeur bold, For on that November morning, His fate was sealed and told.

Ah, why Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore Only among the crowd, and under roofs, That our frail hands have raised? Let me, at least, Here, in the shadow of this aged wood, Offer one hymn---thrice happy, if it find Acceptance in His ear. Father, thy hand Hath reared these venerable columns, thou Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose All these fair ranks of trees.

Noiselessly, around, From perch to perch, the solitary bird Passes; and yon clear spring, that, midst its herbs, Wells softly forth and wandering steeps the roots Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left Thyself without a witness, in these shades, Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace Are here to speak of thee.

Nestled at his root Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower With scented breath, and look so like a smile, Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould, An emanation of the indwelling Life, A visible token of the upholding Love, That are the soul of this wide universe.

Oh, from these sterner aspects of thy face Spare me and mine, nor let us need the wrath Of the mad unchained elements to teach Who rules them.

These frozen skies, Worn by your wings and deafen'd by your cries, Should warn you hence, where milder suns invite, And day alternates with his mother night. You fear perhaps your food will fail you there, Your human carnage, that delicious fare That lured you hither, following still your friend The great Napoleon to the world's bleak end. You fear, because the southern climes pour'd forth Their clustering nations to infest the north, Barvarians, Austrians, those who Drink the Po And those who skirt the Tuscan seas below, With all Germania, Neustria, Belgia, Gaul, Doom'd here to wade thro slaughter to their fall, You fear he left behind no wars, to feed His feather'd canibals and nurse the breed. Fear not, my screamer, call your greedy train, Sweep over Europe, hurry back to Spain, You'll find his legions there; the valliant crew Please best their master when they toil for you. Abundant there they spread the country o'er And taint the breeze with every nation's gore, Iberian, Lussian, British widely strown, But still more wide and copious flows their own. Go where you will; Calabria, Malta, Greece, Egypt and Syria still his fame increase, Domingo's fatten'd isle and India's plains Glow deep with purple drawn from Gallic veins. No Raven's wing can stretch the flight so far As the torn bandrols of Napoleon's war. Choose then your climate, fix your best abode, He'll make you deserts and he'll bring you blood. How could you fear a dearth? have not mankind, Tho slain by millions, millions left behind? Has not CONSCRIPTION still the power to weild Her annual faulchion o'er the human field? A faithful harvester! or if a man Escape that gleaner, shall he scape the BAN? The triple BAN, that like the hound of hell Gripes with three joles, to hold his victim well. Fear nothing then, hatch fast your ravenous brood, Teach them to cry to Bonaparte for food; They'll be like you, of all his suppliant train, The only class that never cries in vain. For see what mutual benefits you lend! (The surest way to fix the mutual friend) While on his slaughter'd troops your tribes are fed, You cleanse his camp and carry off his dead. Imperial Scavenger! but now you know Your work is vain amid these hills of snow. His tentless troops are marbled thro with frost And change to crystal when the breath is lost. Mere trunks of ice, tho limb'd like human frames And lately warm'd with life's endearing flames, They cannot taint the air, the world impest, Nor can you tear one fiber from their breast. No! from their visual sockets, as they lie, With beak and claws you cannot pluck an eye. The frozen orb, preserving still its form, Defies your talons as it braves the storm, But stands and stares to God, as if to know In what curst hands he leaves his world below. Fly then, or starve; tho all the dreadful road From Minsk to Moskow with their bodies strow'd May count some Myriads, yet they can't suffice To feed you more beneath these dreary skies. Go back, and winter in the wilds of Spain; Feast there awhile, and in the next campaign Rejoin your master; for you'll find him then, With his new million of the race of men, Clothed in his thunders, all his flags unfurl'd, Raging and storming o'er the prostrate world. War after war his hungry soul requires, State after State shall sink beneath his fires, Yet other Spains in victim smoke shall rise And other Moskows suffocate the skies, Each land lie reeking with its people's slain And not a stream run bloodless to the main. Till men resume their souls, and dare to shed Earth's total vengeance on the monster's head, Hurl from his blood-built throne this king of woes, Dash him to dust, and let the world repose.",https://allpoetry.com/Advice-To-A-Raven-In-Russia-(1812),"I apologize, but it appears there might be a confusion.

If e'er my memory lose thy lovely name, If my cold heart neglect my kindred race, Let dire destruction seize this guilty frame; My hand shall perish and my voice shall cease. Yet shall the Lord, who hears when Zion calls, O'ertake her foes with terror and dismay, His arm avenge her desolated walls, And raise her children to eternal day.",https://mypoeticside.com/show-classic-poem-1964,"I apologize for the confusion in my previous response.

For here, a prisoner to the stubborn foe, I waste the helpless hours in chains and woe.

He scattered their language, causing strife, Confounding communication, changing life. In that moment, Babel's tower fell, A symbol of mankind's ambitious spell. A lesson learned of pride's excess, And the need for humility to address. Along the banks where Babel's current flows, A reminder of how humanity grows.

Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of individuals or the prosperity of a nation, is of more consequence than we are apt to imagine. In recommending so important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wish it were in my power to do it in such a manner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am sensible that it is one of those subjects in which example has infinitely more power than the most convincing arguments or the highest charms of poetry. Goldsmith's Deserted Village, though possessing these two advantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being deserted. The apparent interest of the rich individuals, who form the taste as well as the laws in that country, has been against him; and with that interest it has been vain to contend. The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavor to combat, seem to me not so difficult to cure. No class of people has any interest in supporting them; unless it be the interest which certain families may feel in vying with each other in sumptuous entertainments. There may indeed be some instances of depraved appetites, which no arguments will conquer; but these must be rare. There are very few persons but what would always prefer a plain dish for themselves, and would prefer it likewise for their quests, if there were no risk of reputation in this case. This difficulty can only be removed by example; and the example should proceed from those whose situation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Persons of this description in America, I should hope, are neither above nor below the influence of truth and reason, when conveyed in language suited to the subject. Whether the manner I have chosen to address my arguments to them be such as to promise any success is what I cannot decide. But I certainly had hopes of doing some good, or I should not have taken the pains of putting so many rimes together. The example of domestic virtues has doubtless a great effect. I only wish to rank simplicity of diet among the virtues. In that case I should hope it will be cherished and more esteemed by others than it is at present. THE AUTHOR Canto I Ye Alps audacious, through the heavens that rise, To cramp the day and hide me from the skies; Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurled, Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world, I sing not to you. A softer theme I choose, A virgin theme, unconscious of the muse, But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire The purest frenzy of poetic fire. Despise it not, ye bards to terror steeled, Who hurl your thunders round the epic field; Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing Joys that the vineyard and the stillhouse bring; Or on some distant fair your notes employ, And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy. I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel, My morning incense, and my evening meal, The sweets of Hasty Pudding. Come, dear bowl, Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul. The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine, It's substance mingled, married in with thine, Shall cool and temper thy superior heat, And save the pains of blowing while I eat. Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue, Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime, And, as they roll in substance, roll in rime, No more thy awkward unpoetic name Should shun the muse, or prejudice thy fame; But rising grateful to the accustomed ear, All bards should catch it, and all realms revere! Assist me first with pious toil to trace Through wrecks of time thy lineage and they race; Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore, (Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore) First gave thee to the world; her works of fame Have lived indeed, but lived without a name. Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days, First learned with stones to crack the well-dried maize, Through the rough sieve to shake the golden shower, In boiling water stir the yellow flour: The yellow flour, bestrewed and stirred with haste, Swell in the flood and thickens to a paste, Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim, Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim; The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks, And the whole mass its true consistence takes. Could but her sacred name, unknown so long, Rise, like her labors, to the son of song, To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays, And blow her pudding with the breath of praise. If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before, I here ascribe her one great virtue more. Not through the rich Peruvian realms alone The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known, But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure, Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure. Dear Hasty Pudding, what unpromised joy Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy! Doomed o'er the world through devious paths to roam, Each clime my country, and each house my home, My soul is soothed, my cares have found an end, I greet my long-lost, unforgotten friend. For thee through Paris, that corrupted town, How long in vain I wandered up and down, Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard, Cold from his cave usurps the morning board. London is lost in smoke and steeped in tea; No Yankee there can lisp the name of thee; The uncouth word, a libel on the town, Would call a proclamation from the crown. For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays, Chilled in their fogs, exclude the generous maize; A grain whose rich luxuriant growth requires Short gentle showers, and bright ethereal fires. But here, though distant from our native shore, With mutual glee we meet and laugh once more. The same! I know thee by that yellow face, That strong complexion of true Indian race, Which time can never change, nor soil impair, Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air; For endless years, though every mild domain, Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign. But man, more fickle, the bold incense claims, In different realms to give thee different names. Thee the soft nations round the warm Levant polanta call, the French of course polenta; Ev'n in thy native regions, how I blush To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee mush! On Hudson's banks, while men of Belgic spawn Insult and eat thee by the name suppawn. All spurious appellations, void of truth; I've better known thee from my earliest youth, Thy name is Hasty Pudding! thus our sires Were wont to greet thee fuming from their fires; And while they argued in thy just defence With logic clear, they thus explained the sense: ""In haste the boiling cauldron, o'er the blaze, Receives and cooks the ready-powdered maize; In haste 'tis served, and then in equal haste, With cooling milk, we make the sweet repast. No carving to be done, no knife to grate The tender ear, and wound the stony plate; But the smooth spoon, just fitted to the lip, And taught with art the yielding mass to dip, By frequent journeys to the bowl well stored, Performs the hasty honors of the board."" Such is the name, significant and clear, A name, a sound to every Yankee dear, But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste Preserve my pure hereditary taste. There are who strive to stamp with disrepute The luscious food, because it feeds the brute; In tropes of high-strained wit, while gaudy prigs Compare thy nursling, man, to pampered pigs; With sovereign scorn I treat the vulgar jest, Nor fear to share thy bounties with the beast. What though the generous cow gives me to quaff The milk nutritious; am I then a calf? Or can the genius of the noisy swine, Though nursed on pudding, thence lay claim to mine? Sure the sweet song, I fashion to thy praise, Runs more melodious than the notes they raise. My song resounding in its grateful glee, No merit claims; I praise myself in thee. My father loved thee through his length of days; For thee his fields were shaded o'er with maize; From thee what health, what vigor he possessed, Ten sturdy freemen from his loins attest; Thy constellation ruled my natal morn, And all my bones were made of Indian corn. Delicious grain! whatever form ti take, To roast or boil, to smother or to bake, In every dish 'tis welcome still to me, But most, my Hasty Pudding, most in thee. Let the green succotash with thee contend, let beans and corn their sweetest juices blend, Let butter drench them in its yellow tide, And a long slice of bacon grace their side; Not all the plate, how famed soe'er it be, Can please my palate like a bowl of thee. Some talk of hoe-cake, fair Virginia's pride, Rich johnny-cake this mouth has often tried; Both please me well, their virtues much the same; Alike their fabric, as allied their fame, Except in dear New England, where the last Receives a dash of pumpkin in the paste, To give it sweetness and improve the taste. But place them all before me, smoking hot, The big round dumpling rolling from the pot; The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast, With suet lined, leads on the Yankee feast; The charlotte brown, within whose crusty sides A belly soft the pulpy apple hides; The yellow bread, whose face like amber glows, And all of Indian that the bakepan knows-- You tempt me not--my favorite greets my eyes, To that loved bowl my spoon by instinct flies. Canto II To mix the food by vicious rules of art, To kill the stomach and to sink the heart, To make mankind to social virtue sour, Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour; For this the kitchen muse first framed her book, Commanding sweat to stream from every cook; Children no more their antic gambols tried, And friend to physic wandered why they died. Not so the Yankee--his abundant feast, With simples furnished, and with plainness dressed, A numerous offspring gathers round the board, And cheers alike the servant and the lord; Whose well-bought hunger prompts the joyous taste, And health attends them from the short repast. While the full pail rewards the milkmaid's toil, The mother sees the morning cauldron boil; To stir the pudding next demands their care, To spread the table and the bowls prepare; To feed the children, as their portions cool, And comb their heads, and send them off to school. Yet may the simplest dish some rules impart, For nature scorns not all the aids of art. Ev'n Hasty Pudding, purest of all food, May still be bad, indifferent, or good, As sage experience the short process guides, Or want of skill, or want of care presides: Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan, To rear the child and long sustain the man; To shield the morals while it mends the size, And all the powers of every food supplies, Attend the lessons that the muse shall bring. Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing. But since, O man! thy life and health demand Not food alone, but labor from thy hand, First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays, Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize; She loves the race that courts her yielding soil, And gives her bounties to the sons of toil. When now the ox, obedient to thy call, Repays the loan that filled the winter stall, Pursue his traces o'er the furrowed plain, And plant in measured hills the golden grain. But when the tender germ begins to shoot, And the green spire declares the sprouting root, Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe, The insidious worm, the all-devouring crow. A little ashes, sprinkled round the spire, Son steeped in rain, will bid the worm retire; The feathered robber with his hungry maw Swift flies the field before your man of straw, A frightful image, such as schoolboys bring When met to burn the Pope or hang the King. Thrice in the season, through each verdant row Wield the strong plowshare and the faithful hoe; The faithful hoe, a double task that takes, To till the summer corn, and roast the winter cakes. Slow springs the blade, while checked by chilling rains, Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains; But when his fiercest fires emblaze the land, Then start the juices, then the roots expand; Then, like a column of Corinthian mold, The stalk struts upward, and the leaves unfold; The busy branches all the ridges fill, Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill. Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done; Leave the last labors to the parent sun; Beneath his genial smiles the well-dressed field, When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield. Now the strong foliage bears the standards high, And shoots the tall top-gallants to the sky; The suckling ears their silky fringes bend, And pregnant grown, their swelling coats distend; The loaded stalk, while still the burden grows, O'erhangs the space that runs between the rows; High as a hop-field waves the silent grove, A safe retreat for little thefts of love, When the pledged roasting-ears invite the maid, To meet her swain beneath the new-formed shade; His generous hand unloads the cumbrous hill, And the green spoils her ready basket fill; Small compensation for the two-fold bliss, The promised wedding and the present kiss. Slight depredations these; but now the moon Calls from his hollow tree the sly raccoon; And while by night he bears his prize away, The bolder squirrel labors through the day. Both thieves alike, but provident of time, A virtue rare, that almost hides their crime. Then let them steal the little stores they can, And fill their granaries from the toils of man; We've one advantage where they take no part, With all their wiles they ne'er have found the art To boil the Hasty Pudding; here we shine Superior far to tenants of the pine; This envied boon to man shall still belong, Unshared by them in substance or in song. At last the closing season browns the plain, And ripe October gathers in the grain; Deep loaded carts the spacious corn-house fill, The sack distended marches to the mill; The laboring mill beneath the burden grounds, And showers the future pudding from the stones; Till the glad housewife greets the powdered gold, And the new crop exterminates the old. Canto III The days grow short; but though the falling sun To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done, Night's pleasing shades his various talk prolong, And yield new subjects to my various song. For now, the corn-house filled, the harvest home, The invited neighbors to the husking come; A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play, Unite their charms, to chase the hours away. Where the huge heap lies centered in the hall, The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall, Brown corn-fed nymphs, and strong hard-handed beaux, Alternate ranged, extend in circling rows, Assume their seats, the solid mass attack; The dry husks rustle, and the corncobs crack; The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound, And the sweet cider trips in silence round. The laws of husking every wight can tell; And sure no laws he ever keeps so well: For each red ear a general kiss he gains, With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains; But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast, Red as her lips, and taper as her waist, She walks the round, and culls one favored beau, Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow. Various the sport, as are the wits and brains Of well-pleased lasses and contending swains; Till the vast mound of corn is swept away, And he that gets the last ear wins the day. Meanwhile the housewife urges all her care, The well-earned feast to hasten and prepare. The sifted meal already waits her hand, The milk is strained, the bowls in order stand, The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes The headlong stream that o'er the milldam breaks) Foams, roars, and rages with incessant toils, So the vexed cauldron rages, roars, and boils. First with clean salt she seasons well the food, Then strews the flour, and thickens all the flood. Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand; To stir it well demands a stronger hand; The husband takes his turn; and round and round The ladle flies; at last the toil is crowned; When to the board the thronging huskers our, And take their seats as at the corn before. I leave them to their feat. There still belong More copious matters to my faithful song. For rules there are, though ne'er unfolded yet, Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate. Some with molasses line the luscious treat, And mix, like bards, the useful with the sweet. A wholesome dish, and well deserving praise, A great resource in those bleak wintry days, When the chilled earth lies buried deep in snow, And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow. Blessed cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ, Mother of Egypt's God--but sure, for me, Were I to leave my God, I'd worship thee. How oft thy teats these pious hands have pressed! How oft thy bounties proved my only feast! How oft I've fed thee with my favorite grain! And roared, like thee, to find thy children slain! Ye swains who know her various worth to prize, Ah! house her well from winter's angry skies. Potatoes, pumpkins, should her sadness cheer, Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer; When spring returns she'll well acquaint the loan, And nurse at once your infants and her own. Milk then with pudding I should always choose; To this in future I confine my muse, Till she in haste some further hints unfold, Well for the young, nor useless to the old. First in your bowl the milk abundant take, Then drop with are along the silver lake Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide; But when their growing mass no more can sink, When the soft island looms above the brink, Then check your hand; you've got the portion's due, So taught our sires, and what they taught is true. There is a choice in spoons. Though small appear The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear. The deep-bowled Gallie spoon, contrived to scoop In ample draughts the thin diluted soup, Performs not well in those substantial things, Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings; Where the strong labial muscles must embrace, The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space. With ease to enter and discharge the freight, A bowl less concave but still more dilate, Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size, A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes. Experienced feeders can alone impart A rule so much above the lore of art. These tuneful lips that thousand spoons have tried, With just precision could the point decide, Though not in song; the muse but poorly shines In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines; Yet the true form, as near as she can tell, Is that small section of a goose-egg shell, Which in two equal portions shall divide The distance from the center to the side. Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin. Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me, Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee; Just in the zenith your wise head project, Your full spoon, rising in a line direct, Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall, The wide-mouthed bowl will surely catch them all.",https://mypoeticside.com/show-classic-poem-1965,"To make a good hasty pudding you must learn To bear a little, and you must not burn Yourself nor others. You must stir with care, If you would have it wholesome, good, and fair; And when 't is done, take care of what you make, Lest in the eating you the stomach ache. And though the best of puddings may be spoiled, It would be prudent to begin the child, Lest it be scalded, for we plainly see The child that's scalded will remember thee. Now how the pudding ought to be begun, That the young cook may be instructed soon, Attend:—And first, come in with gentle fire, Not such as makes the heart of pottage tire; And fill the pot with water till it boil, And then put in the meal withouten toil, And while it stirs pour in the luscious milk, And after that put in a pound of sugar, And ginger too, which some do think a fault; But that I answer by a grain of salt, Or two, which you may take, if so inclined; Then boil and stir, and be not left behind. If by neglect it burns and so tastes rank, Add a great spoonful of the whitest clank; Then taste again, and, if the taste be right, Pour it in dishes with a quick delight; That when 't is cold, and settled firm, and neat, It may be eat with profit and with heat.",17922,"I apologize for the confusion, but it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the attribution.

Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of life or to its preservation, appears to be essential. In the following poem, I have endeavored to present a picture of rural felicity and the virtues that blossom in the tranquil shades of domestic life. It was composed during a stay in Chambery, in the beautiful region of Savoy, where nature's charms inspired my muse. Canto I Amidst the hills and valleys fair, Where streams meander, fresh and clear, A cottage stands, a humble dome, A sanctuary, love's sweet home. Beneath its roof, in peace and mirth, Dwells innocence, the child of worth. With temperance and simple fare, Contentment reigns, devoid of care. The joys that spring from homely toil, Their hearts with pure affection coil. The husband, wife, and children dear, In harmony, they persevere. Canto II The morning sun with rosy light, Awakens them to life's delight. They greet the day with grateful hearts, Each task, with joy, their soul imparts. With frugal meal and rustic cheer, They share their bread with those held dear. The simple pleasures, life affords, A bounty pure, where love records. Yet, in this realm of peace, there lies, A lesson wise, to make us wise. For nature's gifts, in balance known, A harmony of heart is sown. Canto III As twilight paints the evening skies, They gather close, with love's soft ties. Around the hearth, a sacred place, They share their tales, their dreams embrace. Their prayers ascend to Heaven above, In gratitude for life and love. With spirits pure, they find their way, In virtue's path, where goodness sway. Thus, in this haven, simple, small, True happiness, the sweetest call. For he who blends the useful, dear, Finds joy and bliss, year after year. Omni tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci, He makes a good breakfast who mixes pudding with molasses. Thus, simplicity and virtue's balm, Their lives with grace and peace embalm.",17160,0,0,0,0,FALSE

He saw, once more, bright Del'ware's silver stream, And Penn's throng'd city cast a cheerful gleam; The dome of state, that met his eager eye, Now heav'd its arches in a loftier sky. The bursting gates unfold: and lo, within, A solemn train in conscious glory shine. The well-known forms his eye had trac'd before, In diff'rent realms along th' extended shore; Here, grac'd with nobler fame, and rob'd in state, They look'd and mov'd magnificently great. High on the foremost seat, in living light, Majestic Randolph caught the hero's sight: Fair on his head, the civic crown was plac'd, And the first dignity his sceptre grac'd. He opes the cause, and points in prospect far, Thro' all the toils that wait th' impending war -- But, hapless sage, thy reign must soon be o'er, To lend thy lustre, and to shine no more. So the bright morning star, from shades of ev'n, Leads up the dawn, and lights the front of heav'n, Points to the waking world the sun's broad way, Then veils his own, and shines above the day. And see great Washington behind thee rise, Thy following sun, to gild our morning skies; O'er shadowy climes to pour the enliv'ning flame, The charms of freedom and the fire of fame. Th' ascending chief adorn'd his splendid seat, Like Randolph, ensign'd with a crown of state; Where the green patriot bay beheld, with pride, The hero's laurel springing by its side; His sword, hung useless, on his graceful thigh, On Britain still he cast a filial eye; But sov'reign fortitude his visage bore, To meet their legions on th' invaded shore. Sage Franklin next arose, in awful mien, And smil'd, unruffled, o'er th' approaching scene; High, on his locks of age, a wreath was brac'd, Palm of all arts, that e'er a mortal grac'd; Beneath him lies the sceptre kings have borne, And crowns and laurels from their temples torn. Nash, Rutledge, Jefferson, in council great, And Jay and Laurens op'd the rolls of fate. The Livingstons, fair Freedom's gen'rous band, The Lees, the Houstons, fathers of the land, O'er climes and kingdoms turn'd their ardent eyes, Bade all th' oppressed to speedy vengeance rise; All pow'rs of state, in their extended plan, Rise from consent to shield the rights of man. Bold Wolcott urg'd the all-important cause; With steady hand the solemn scene he draws; Undaunted firmness with his wisdom join'd, Nor kings nor worlds could warp his stedfast mind. Now, graceful rising from his purple throne, In radiant robes, immortal Hosmer shone; Myrtles and bays his learned temples bound, The statesman's wreath, the poet's garland crown'd: Morals and laws expand his liberal soul, Beam from his eyes, and in his accents roll. But lo! an unseen hand the curtain drew, And snatch'd the patriot from the hero's view; Wrapp'd in the shroud of death, he sees descend The guide of nations and the muses' friend. Columbus dropp'd a tear. The angel's eye Trac'd the freed spirit mounting thro' the sky. Adams, enrag'd, a broken charter bore, And lawless acts of ministerial pow'r; Some injur'd right in each loose leaf appears, A king in terrors and a land in tears; From all the guileful plots the veil he drew, With eye retortive look'd creation through; Op'd the wide range of nature's boundless plan, Trac'd all the steps of liberty and man; Crowds rose to vengeance while his accents rung, And Independence thunder'd from his tongue.",https://poetandpoem.com/Joel-Barlow/The-First-American-Congress,"I apologize for the confusion, but it seems there might be some confusion or misattribution.

In vain, with bending oars, and lab'ring sails, The anchored vessel felt the treacherous gales; The mountain-billows, with tremendous sweep, Tore the strong helm, and bore to raging deep. Swift, o'er the foam, the buoyant pinnace flew, And, where it went, the waters brighter grew. Here, fear to venture, yet a wish to go, There, dread of death, and thirst for gold, create In COLUMBUS' soul alternate turns of fate.

In awe, he gazed upon this wondrous sight, A world unseen, with wonders to alight. For in his heart, a vision vast unfurled, A new horizon, a virgin world. With daring spirit and unwavering will, He sailed beyond the known, o'er waters still. Through doubts and dangers, he pressed ahead, In search of lands beyond the ocean's bed. And as he sailed, his crew, with hope and fear, Kept watchful eyes on what lay distant, near. In trepidation, wonder, and surprise, They saw new lands beneath the changing skies. From south to north, their journey took them far, A voyage that would alter life's memoir. For on that night, the world's course changed its track, A new chapter penned, a history to unpack. Columbus looked, and in his vision grand, He saw a future, built on uncharted land. His daring voyage, a legacy so grand, A testament to courage, vision, hand in hand.",2720,0,0,0,0,FALSE
