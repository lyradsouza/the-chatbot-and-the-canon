He builded his cabin far away, Where the prairie flower bloomed wild; Her love made lighter all his toil, And joy and hope around him smiled. She plied her hands to life's homely tasks, And helped to build his fortunes up; While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet, Were mingled and mixed in her cup. He sowed in his fields of golden grain, All the strength of his manly prime; Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees, Was as sweet as the dollar's chime. She toiled and waited through weary years For the fortune that came at length; But toil and care and hope deferred, Had stolen and wasted her strength. The cabin changed to a stately home, Rich carpets were hushing her tread; But light was fading from her eye, And the bloom from her cheek had fled. Slower and heavier grew her step, While his gold and his gains increased; But his proud domain had not the charm Of her humble home in the East. Within her eye was a restless light, And a yearning that never ceased, A longing to see the dear old home She had left in the distant East. A longing to clasp her mother's hand, And nestle close to her heart, And to feel the heavy cares of life Like the sun-kissed shadows depart. Her husband was adding field to field, And new wealth to his golden store; And little thought the shadow of death Was entering in at his door. He had no line to sound the depths Of her tears repressed and unshed; Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart Could be starving, but not for bread. The hungry heart was stilled at last; Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.

Through joys and trials, they built their life, Overcoming struggles and times of strife, Her laughter rang like a sweet refrain, In every joy, love's true domain. From the East she came, a world away, But love's foundation did not sway, For in their union, they found their home, Wherever they roamed, together they'd roam. Years passed by, with memories made, Love's tapestry woven, never to fade, Through silver strands of hair and time, Their bond grew stronger, more sublime. And when the days turned to twilight's gleam, They stood together, a lifelong team, Through thick and thin, side by side, The fair, young bride and her groom did confide.

Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves? And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? And if the body does not do as much as the Soul? And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul? 2 The love of the Body of man or woman balks account, The body itself balks account, That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. The expression of the face balks account, But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and flannel, To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and from the heave of the water, The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horse-man in his saddle, Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the garden or cow-yard, The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv'd neck and the counting; Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's breast with the little child, Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, and count. 3 I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, And in them were the fathers of sons, and in them were the fathers of sons. This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. 4 I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough, To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, All things please the soul, but these please the soul well. 5 This is the female form, A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed, Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, Undulating into the willing and yielding day, Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day. This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. The female contains all qualities and tempers them, She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.

This epic poem is part of his collection ""Leaves of Grass"" and is considered one of his most significant works. In ""Song of Myself,"" Whitman celebrates the vastness and diversity of the human experience, connecting it to the greater entity of nature and the universe. The line ""Who includes diversity and is Nature"" highlights the interconnectedness of all living beings and their place within the natural world. Whitman presents the idea that Nature itself embodies diversity, encompassing a wide range of forms, beings, and experiences. This notion is a recurring theme in Whitman's poetry, as he seeks to embrace all aspects of existence, from the smallest to the grandest, and find unity in diversity. By acknowledging that diversity is an essential part of nature, Whitman advocates for an inclusive and egalitarian perspective on life. He celebrates the uniqueness and individuality of each person, recognizing that they are all integral parts of the larger whole. In this way, Whitman's poetry encourages a sense of unity, compassion, and acceptance of others, regardless of their differences. Throughout ""Song of Myself"" and his other works, Whitman's celebration of diversity and nature reflects his deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living things and the beauty of the world around us. His poetry often serves as a reminder to embrace and cherish the vast tapestry of life, recognizing that each thread, no matter how diverse, is a vital part of the grand design.",1097,0,0,0,0,FALSE

""Let there be light!"" and God's first born, Clothed in the princely garb of morn, Assumed his long pre-ordered place, And dropped the mantling from his face.

This short and powerful poem is often referred to as a ""we"" poem, where a group of individuals collectively speak as one entity. The poem provides a glimpse into the lives of a group of young, rebellious individuals who have dropped out of school. The use of the word ""We"" emphasizes the group identity and camaraderie among these individuals. The repetition of ""We"" at the beginning of each line creates a rhythmic and impactful effect, highlighting their sense of unity and self-assuredness. The statement ""We real cool"" can be interpreted as their defiance or a proclamation of independence, suggesting that they consider themselves to be cool, unique, or above the norms of society. However, it also hints at the underlying vulnerability and uncertainty they may feel about their choices. The final line, ""Left school,"" is straightforward and carries a lot of weight. It indicates their decision to drop out of school, a significant event that can have far-reaching consequences for their future prospects and opportunities. Overall, ""We Real Cool"" is a thought-provoking poem that captures the rebellious spirit of youth and the consequences of certain life choices.

The poem delves into the emotional and psychological aftermath of having experienced abortion. The line ""Abortions will not let you forget"" speaks to the lasting impact and haunting memories that can linger with a woman after such an experience. In ""The Mother,"" the speaker, who has had multiple abortions, addresses the children she never had, expressing her complex emotions of guilt, grief, and regret. The poem explores the emotional weight and consequences of the choices made, highlighting the profound impact on the lives of both the speaker and the unborn children. The line you've shared is just the beginning of a poignant and deeply personal exploration of the theme, addressing the profound psychological impact of abortion on a woman's life. Gwendolyn Brooks' poem touches on the complexity of this subject and reflects on the emotional toll it can take on those involved. It's a somber reminder of the weight of certain decisions and the lasting effects they can have on individuals.",1011,1,1,0,2,TRUE

The line ""The woman is perfected"" might be seen as a commentary on societal expectations and pressures placed upon women to conform to specific roles and ideals. It could also be interpreted as a statement of self-discovery and empowerment, suggesting that a woman can achieve a state of fulfillment and completeness on her own terms.

They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.

One by one he subdued his father's trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer.

Earth’s the right place for love: I don’t know where it's likely to go better.

In this haunting and evocative poem, Glück explores themes of loss, memory, and the aftermath of a traumatic event. The dream in question seems to be a recurring dream where the speaker and someone else, presumably a companion or a loved one, are pulling bodies out of a lake. The bodies could symbolize the emotional burdens or unresolved traumas that the speaker carries with them, perhaps representing past experiences or painful memories that continue to resurface in their dreams. The act of pulling bodies out of the lake may also be a metaphorical representation of facing and confronting the pain and suffering of the past. It could signify a desire to heal, to come to terms with difficult emotions, and to address the aftermath of loss or tragedy. Dreams often serve as a means of processing subconscious thoughts and emotions. In this poem, the dream becomes a poignant metaphor for the complexities of dealing with grief and the weight of past experiences. Glück's imagery and language evoke a sense of haunting and introspection, inviting readers to contemplate the enduring impact of loss and the process of finding solace and resolution. It's worth noting that poetry, like any form of art, can be open to various interpretations, and different readers may resonate with different aspects of the poem. In the case of ""Aftermath,"" readers may find themselves reflecting on their own experiences of loss, healing, and the power of dreams to illuminate hidden emotions.",1184,0,1,0,1,TRUE

The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens’ gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a pony’s last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy.

The context of this statement is essential to fully understand its implications. If everyone is happier, it might indicate a positive shift in circumstances or a collective improvement in well-being. The disappearance of sadness could suggest that individuals have found ways to cope with or overcome their struggles, leading to a more content and joyful atmosphere. However, the question ""where did the sadness go?"" also invites deeper contemplation. It implies that sadness is an inherent part of the human experience, and its absence raises questions about its nature and significance. Sadness is a natural emotion that all people experience at various points in life. It can be a response to loss, disappointment, or challenges, and it plays a role in shaping our emotional landscape. The question might also point to the complexities of emotions and how they ebb and flow throughout life. While everyone may be happier in the present moment, it's possible that sadness has not disappeared entirely but is merely temporarily masked or overshadowed by happiness. Emotions are dynamic and ever-changing, and it is natural for people to experience a range of feelings over time. The statement encourages us to reflect on the fluidity of emotions and the delicate balance between happiness and sadness. It reminds us of the importance of acknowledging and processing our feelings, even as we embrace moments of joy and contentment. Understanding and embracing the full spectrum of human emotions allows us to cultivate resilience, empathy, and a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of the human experience.",1347,0,0,0,0,FALSE

It encapsulates a fundamental tenet of Christian theology that Jesus is the savior of humanity, and through his life, death, and resurrection, he offers the gift of salvation and reconciliation with God. In Christian doctrine, Jesus Christ is considered the Son of God and the redeemer of humanity. His sacrifice on the cross is seen as an atonement for the sins of all people, providing a way for individuals to be forgiven and restored to a right relationship with God. This concept is central to various Christian denominations and is often expressed in creeds, prayers, and doctrinal statements. The belief in Jesus as the sole means of salvation is a core element that unites Christians worldwide. The line reflects the foundational belief in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, emphasizing the Christian faith's focus on the importance of Jesus as the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6).

Dear Master, now it is a time, A time of great distress; We'll follow after things divine, And pray for happiness. Master. Then will the happy day appear, That virtue shall increase; Lay up the sword and drop the spear, And nations seek for peace. Servant. Then shall we see the happy end, Tho' still in some distress; That distant foes shall act like friends, And leave their wickedness. Master. We pray that God would give us grace, And make us humble too; Let ev'ry nation seek for peace, And virtue make a show. Servant. Then we shall see the happy day, That virtue is in power; Each holy act shall have its sway, Extend from shore to shore. Master. This is the work of God's own hand, We see by precepts given; To relieve distress and save the land, Must be the pow'r of heav'n. Servant. Now glory be unto our God, Let ev'ry nation sing; Strive to obey his holy word, That Christ may take them in. Master. Where endless joys shall never cease, Blest Angels constant sing; The glory of their God increase, Hallelujahs to their King. Servant. Thus the Dialogue shall end, Strive to obey the word; When ev'ry nation act like friends, Shall be the sons of God. Believe me now my Christian friends, Believe your friend call'd HAMMON: You cannot to your God attend, And serve the God of Mammon. If God is pleased by his own hand To relieve distresses here; And grant a peace throughout the the land, 'Twill be a happy year. 'Tis God alone can give us peace; It's not the pow'r of man: When virtuous pow'r shall increase, 'Twill beautify the land. Then shall we rejoice and sing By pow'r of virtues word, Come sweet Jesus, heav'nly King, Thou art the Son of God. When virtue comes in bright array, Discovers ev'ry sin; We see the dangers of the day, And fly unto our King.

Oh, Heaven! and is there no relief This side the silent grave— To soothe the pain—to quell the grief And anguish of a slave? Come Liberty, thou cheerful sound, Roll through my ravished ears!

Come my servant, follow me,"" This line appears to be a command or invitation from a master to their servant, asking the servant to follow them. The use of the word ""master"" suggests a position of authority or leadership, while ""servant"" implies someone in a subservient role who serves and obeys the master's instructions. The phrase ""follow me"" is a directive for the servant to accompany the master, likely to perform a task or fulfill a duty. It can also symbolize a deeper meaning, such as the servant being called to align themselves with the master's values, teachings, or example. The context of the line is essential for understanding the specific relationship between the master and servant, as well as the purpose behind the command. It could be part of a historical or fictional narrative, a religious or philosophical teaching, or even a metaphorical expression. Overall, the line captures a moment of authority and obedience, where the master calls upon the servant to be attentive and responsive to their instruction.

The poem expresses the speaker's contemplation on the conflict between science and imagination, and the limitations that scientific inquiry may impose on the mysteries and wonders of the universe. The line evokes a sense of mystery and introspection. It suggests that the speaker's thoughts and insights are revealed to them during the dark and solitary hours of the night when the mind is free to wander and explore abstract ideas. Throughout the poem, Poe explores the allure of imagination and the vastness of the unknown. He contemplates how scientific pursuits can provide answers and explanations but may also demystify and constrain the imaginative realm of the human mind. The phrase ""visions of the dark night"" invites readers to delve into the realm of dreams, the subconscious, and the untamed thoughts that emerge when the world is shrouded in darkness. It serves as a poetic entryway into a realm of contemplation where the boundaries of reality and imagination blur, and the mind is open to possibilities beyond the limits of reason.

The poem is a haunting and tragic tale of love and loss, and it is one of Poe's most famous and beloved works. The lines set the stage for the narrative, suggesting that the events described in the poem took place a long time ago in a far-off kingdom located by the sea. The use of repetition (""many and many a year ago"") adds to the sense of time passing and the distance between the events and the present moment. Throughout the poem, the narrator mourns the death of his beloved, Annabel Lee, and speaks of their eternal love. The poem's themes revolve around the enduring power of love and the idea of love transcending even death. The atmospheric setting of a kingdom by the sea, combined with Poe's masterful use of language and imagery, creates a captivating and emotional journey for readers. ""Annabel Lee"" is celebrated for its melancholic beauty and its exploration of the profound impact of love and loss on the human soul. It remains one of Poe's most memorable and enduring works in the realm of romantic poetry.",996,1,1,0,2,TRUE

College is a time of significant transitions, self-discovery, and the forging of new relationships. While some college relationships may lead to lasting commitments, others might not withstand the changes and challenges that come with this transformative phase of life. Several factors contribute to the prevalence of breakups in college: Personal Growth: College is a time of personal growth and self-discovery. Students may evolve and change during their college years, and these changes can sometimes lead to shifts in relationships. Academic Stress: College students often face academic stress and time constraints. Balancing coursework, extracurricular activities, and social life can be challenging, and this can put a strain on relationships. Distance: Some college relationships face the obstacle of distance, especially if partners attend different colleges or universities. Peer Influence: College brings exposure to new people and social circles, which can influence relationship dynamics. Different Life Goals: As students mature and clarify their life goals, they might realize that they have different aspirations or plans that may not align with their current partners. Emotional Growth: Emotional maturity and communication skills continue to develop during the college years, and some relationships may struggle to adapt to these changes. While breakups are common in college, they are not limited to this phase of life. Relationships can evolve and change at any stage, and experiencing breakups is a normal part of life. It provides opportunities for growth, self-reflection, and learning more about one's desires and needs in future relationships.",1368,0,0,0,0,FALSE

This line is the opening verse of the poem ""Famous"" by Naomi Shihab Nye. The poem is a simple yet profound reflection on the notion of fame and how different beings perceive and experience it. The line suggests that the river is a significant and well-known feature of the fish's environment. To the fish, the river is not just a physical element; it is an essential part of their world and something they intimately connect with. Through this line, the poet highlights the idea that fame or significance is subjective and context-dependent. What may be famous or important to one entity (in this case, the river to the fish) might be ordinary or overlooked by others. The poem delves into this theme further, exploring how fame can be found in everyday experiences and the simple things that hold meaning to various beings. Naomi Shihab Nye's poem ""Famous"" encourages readers to contemplate how our perceptions of fame and importance are influenced by our perspectives and individual experiences. It invites us to find significance and wonder in the seemingly ordinary aspects of life and appreciate the unique ways in which all living beings interact with their surroundings.",835,1,1,0,2,TRUE

The poem is an extended metaphor that explores the contrasting experiences of freedom and confinement, as symbolized by the free bird and the caged bird. The line depicts the image of a free bird joyfully leaping and soaring through the air, carried by the wind. The ""free bird"" represents the spirit of freedom and independence, able to move and roam without limitations. Throughout the poem, Maya Angelou juxtaposes the free bird's unrestricted flight with the experience of a caged bird, which is trapped and unable to enjoy the same level of freedom. The caged bird serves as a symbol of those who face oppression, discrimination, or societal restrictions that limit their ability to live freely and fulfill their potential. ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is a profound reflection on the themes of freedom, identity, and the resilience of the human spirit. It became the title of the first volume of Angelou's autobiographical series, which recounts her life and experiences as a young girl growing up in the racially segregated American South. The poem's poignant imagery and powerful metaphor have made it an enduring and resonant piece of literature, touching the hearts of readers across generations and inspiring discussions about social justice and the pursuit of equality.",973,1,1,0,2,TRUE

This line is the opening verse of the poem ""Sympathy"" by Paul Laurence Dunbar. The poem is a poignant expression of empathy for the caged bird and serves as a metaphor for the African American experience during the time of racial segregation and oppression. In these lines, the poet personifies the caged bird, expressing that he understands the bird's feelings of captivity, confinement, and longing for freedom. The word ""alas"" conveys a sense of sorrow and regret for the bird's plight, acknowledging the pain and suffering it endures. ""Sympathy"" uses the caged bird as a symbol to explore the larger theme of the African American struggle for freedom and equality. During the time when Dunbar wrote this poem in the late 19th century, African Americans faced systemic racism, discrimination, and social injustices, akin to being confined in a metaphorical cage. Dunbar's poem captures the emotional and psychological toll of oppression and the desire for freedom and equality. Despite the challenges and hardships faced, the poem ends with a note of resilience and hope, suggesting that the caged bird's spirit remains unbroken and its yearning for freedom persists. ""Sympathy"" is considered one of Paul Laurence Dunbar's most celebrated works and remains a powerful representation of the African American experience during a pivotal period in history. Its evocative imagery and emotional depth continue to resonate with readers, and it stands as a testament to the enduring power of poetry to illuminate social and human struggles.",1087,1,1,0,2,TRUE

The poem explores the theme of concealment and the practice of hiding one's true feelings and emotions behind a metaphorical mask. In these lines, the poet suggests that people wear masks to hide their true thoughts, feelings, or struggles from the world. The mask ""grins and lies,"" implying that it presents a facade of happiness and contentment, while underneath, there may be pain, sorrow, or other emotions hidden from view. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet, wrote ""We Wear the Mask"" during the late 19th century, a time when African Americans faced significant racial discrimination and oppression. The poem can be interpreted as a commentary on the act of concealing one's true identity or emotions as a means of survival in a society that may not fully accept or understand one's experiences. Throughout the poem, Dunbar explores the complexities of wearing a mask, touching on themes of identity, societal expectations, and the burdens carried by individuals in marginalized communities. Despite the outward appearance of strength or happiness, the poem acknowledges the toll that hiding one's true self can take on a person's spirit. ""We Wear the Mask"" remains a significant and thought-provoking work in African American literature, resonating with readers and sparking discussions about the masks people wear to navigate the complexities of life and society. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy, understanding, and embracing the multifaceted aspects of humanity.",1288,1,1,0,2,TRUE

These lines are from the African American folk song ""Jump Back, Honey,"" which has its roots in the blues and minstrel traditions. The song originated during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was commonly performed in minstrel shows and other entertainment venues. The song's lyrics typically feature a call-and-response structure, where one singer leads with a line, and the audience or other singers respond with a refrain. In this case, the leader sings, ""Seen my lady home las' night,"" and the response is ""Jump back, honey, jump back."" The phrase ""seen my lady home las' night"" suggests that the singer accompanied a woman to her home the previous night, which may imply a romantic interest or a sense of chivalry. The response, ""Jump back, honey, jump back,"" is an enthusiastic and playful exclamation. It adds a joyful and lively element to the song, encouraging participation and creating a sense of community among the performers and the audience. As with many folk songs from this era, ""Jump Back, Honey"" reflects the cultural and social context of African American communities during the time of its creation. It embodies the spirit of resilience, joy, and creativity that characterized African American musical traditions in the face of adversity and challenges. While the origins of ""Jump Back, Honey"" are deeply rooted in a complex historical context, it is important to recognize and celebrate the contributions of African American artists and musicians who have enriched American culture through their creativity and musical expressions.",1189,1,1,0,2,TRUE

In this poem, Cummings employs his characteristic style of innovative language and wordplay to craft a satirical commentary on a certain group of women living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The phrase ""furnished souls"" can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one level, it may suggest that these women have lives that are comfortable, secure, and equipped with all the conveniences of modern life (""furnished"" implying well-provided for). However, on another level, it could be seen as a metaphor for their superficiality or their adherence to societal expectations and norms (""furnished"" implying superficially adorned or decorated). The poem continues to describe these women in a critical and ironic tone, satirizing their conformity and artificiality. Cummings uses humor and wit to expose the pretentiousness and shallowness he perceives in this group of individuals. As with many of Cummings' poems, ""The Cambridge Ladies Who Live in Furnished Souls"" is open to interpretation and offers different layers of meaning. It reflects the poet's keen observation of human behavior and society's tendencies toward conformity and insincerity.

The poem explores the lives of the inhabitants of a town, focusing on the character named ""anyone"" and another character named ""noone."" The town is described as ""pretty,"" suggesting a superficial beauty or charm. The phrase ""how town"" is intriguing as it doesn't follow conventional grammar rules. It may be interpreted as ""any town"" or ""anywhere"" or even ""no place,"" playing with the concept of identity and individuality within the context of a community. Throughout the poem, Cummings uses a unique structure and syntax to create a sense of detachment and anonymity in describing the lives of the town's inhabitants. The poem touches on themes of conformity, anonymity, and the passage of time. The poem also presents a love story between ""anyone"" and ""noone,"" two characters whose names reflect the anonymity and universality of their experiences. The poem addresses the complexities of human relationships, the fleeting nature of life, and the cyclical patterns of existence. Cummings' unconventional style encourages readers to delve deeper into the layers of meaning and interpretation.

Cummings (Edward Estlin Cummings). Cummings is renowned for his unique style of poetry, characterized by innovative use of language, syntax, and punctuation. The poem celebrates the intimate connection between two individuals and the feeling of wholeness and joy experienced when they are together. It explores the idea of love and physical intimacy as a means of enhancing one's sense of self and body. Cummings' characteristic use of lowercase letters and lack of punctuation allows for an open and fluid interpretation of the poem. The poem's unconventional structure gives the reader the freedom to explore and experience the emotions expressed in their own unique way. Throughout the poem, Cummings employs wordplay and visual imagery to convey the essence of love and unity between the speaker and their partner. The poem exudes a sense of romance, sensuality, and vulnerability, capturing the beauty of being in a close and intimate relationship. As with much of Cummings' poetry, ""[i like my body when it is with your]"" celebrates the complexities of human emotions and relationships. It allows readers to connect with the universal feelings of love, desire, and the sense of completeness found in a profound connection with another person.",1027,1,1,0,2,TRUE

On April 29, 1975, during the final stages of the Vietnam War, the U.S. Armed Forces Radio in Saigon played the song ""White Christmas"" by Irving Berlin as a secret code to signal the start of Operation Frequent Wind. This operation was the largest helicopter evacuation in history and aimed to evacuate American civilians and South Vietnamese refugees from Saigon as the city fell to North Vietnamese forces. The choice of the song ""White Christmas"" was intentional and served as a coded message to signal the evacuation. It was chosen because it had no specific military connotations, and its broadcast would not raise suspicion or panic among the general public. However, it had been pre-arranged as the signal for all U.S. military personnel and eligible civilians to report to designated evacuation points for immediate evacuation. Operation Frequent Wind was executed by a large fleet of helicopters, which airlifted thousands of people from various locations in and around Saigon to U.S. Navy ships offshore. The operation continued for two days, successfully rescuing over 7,000 Americans and an estimated 5,000 Vietnamese refugees. The fall of Saigon marked the end of the Vietnam War and the unification of Vietnam under communist rule. The evacuation of American civilians and Vietnamese refugees during Operation Frequent Wind was a significant event in the history of the war and represented a crucial effort to save lives during a tumultuous and challenging time.",1524,0,0,0,0,FALSE

I used to be a fag now I’m a checkbox. The pen tip jabbed in my back, I feel the mark of progress. I will not dance alone in the municipal graveyard at midnight, blasting sad songs on my phone, for nothing. I promise you, I was here. I felt things that made death so large it was indistinguishable from air—and I went on destroying inside it like wind in a storm. The way Lil Peep says I’ll be back in the mornin’  when you know how it ends. The way I kept dancing when the song was over, because it freed me. The way the streetlight blinks once, before waking up for its night shift, like we do. The way we look up and whisper sorry to each other, the boy and I, when there’s teeth. When there’s always teeth, on purpose. When I threw myself into gravity and made it work. Ha. I made it out by the skin of my griefs. I used to be a fag now I’m lit. Ha. Once, at a party set on a rooftop in Brooklyn for an “artsy vibe,” a young woman said, sipping her drink, You’re so lucky. You’re gay plus you get to write about war and stuff. I’m just white. [Pause.] I got nothing. [Laughter, glasses clinking.] Unlike feelings, blood gets realer when you feel it. Because everyone knows yellow pain, pressed into American letters, turns to gold. Our sorrow Midas-touched. Napalm with a rainbow afterglow. I’m trying to be real but it costs too much. They say the Earth spins and that’s why we fall but everyone knows it’s the music. It’s been proven difficult to dance to machine gun fire. Still, my people made a rhythm this way. A way. My people, so still, in the photographs, as corpses. My failure was that I got used to it. I looked at us, mangled under the TIME photographer’s shadow, and stopped thinking, Get up, get up. I saw the graveyard steam in the pinkish dawn and knew the dead were still breathing. Ha. If they come for me, take me home take me out. What if it wasn’t the crash that made me, but the debris? What if it was meant this way: the mother, the lexicon, the line of cocaine on the mohawked boy’s collarbone in an East Village sublet in 2007? What’s wrong with me, Doc? There must be a pill for this. Too late—these words already shrapnel in your brain. Impossible in high school, I am now the ultimate linebacker. I plow through the page, making a path for you, dear reader, going nowhere. Because the fairy tales were right. You’ll need magic to make it out of  here. Long ago, in another life, on an Amtrak through Iowa, I saw, for a few blurred seconds, a man standing in the middle of a field of winter grass, hands at his side, back to me, all of him stopped there save for his hair scraped by low wind. When the countryside resumed its wash of gray wheat, tractors, gutted barns, black sycamores in herdless pastures, I started to cry. I put my copy of Didion’s The White Album down and folded a new dark around my head. The woman beside me stroked my back saying, in a Midwestern accent that wobbled with tenderness, Go on son. You get that out now. No shame in breakin’ open. You get that out and I’ll fetch us some tea. Which made me lose it even more. She came back with Lipton in paper cups, her eyes nowhere blue and there. She was silent all the way to Missoula, where she got off and said, patting my knee, God is good. God is good. I can say it was beautiful now, my harm, because it belonged to no one else. To be a dam for damage. My shittiness will not enter the world, I thought, and quickly became my own hero. Do you know how many hours I’ve wasted watching straight boys play video games? Enough. Time is a mother. Lest we forget, a morgue is also a community center. In my language, the one I recall now only by closing my eyes, the word for love is Yêu. And the word for weakness is Yếu. How you say what you mean changes what you say. Some call this prayer. I call it watch your mouth. When they zipped my mother in a body bag I whispered: Rose, get out of there. Your plants are dying. Enough is enough. Body, doorway that you are, be more than what I’ll pass through. Stillness. That’s what it was. The man in the field in the red sweater, he was so still he became, somehow, more true, like a knife wound in a landscape painting. Like him, I caved. I caved and decided it will be joy from now on.

The imagery used in the lines suggests a sense of detachment, perhaps a loss of emotion or vulnerability. ""I can no longer blush"" indicates that the person has lost their capacity to experience embarrassment or shame. Blushing is often associated with a reaction to feeling self-conscious or embarrassed, and its absence may imply a state of emotional numbness or indifference. The phrase ""Half-face towards the starchy scape"" creates a vivid visual image. The term ""starchy scape"" could be interpreted in various ways, depending on the context and the intended meaning. ""Scape"" could refer to a landscape or environment, and ""starchy"" might imply something rigid, stiff, or formal. The combination of ""half-face"" and ""starchy scape"" suggests a partial engagement with the surroundings, possibly portraying a person who is emotionally distant or withdrawn.

""Raised on a cozy diet of conditional love"" suggests that the speaker's experience of love during their upbringing was limited or conditional. Conditional love refers to love that is given only under certain conditions or when certain expectations are met, rather than being unconditional and freely given. The use of the word ""cozy"" adds a sense of comfort or familiarity, but it also hints at the limitations and restrictions in the love they received. ""I learned to emoji from teevee"" points to the influence of television (often informally referred to as ""teevee"") on the speaker's emotional expression. The use of ""emoji"" as a verb is a creative and modern way of conveying that the speaker's emotional language or expression was influenced by the emotive portrayals they saw on television. Emojis are graphical representations used in digital communication to express emotions, ideas, or reactions, and they have become a prominent form of modern communication. Together, these lines suggest that the speaker's experience of love during their upbringing was not entirely nurturing or unconditional. Instead, they learned to express emotions and communicate using the emotive cues they observed in media like television, where emotions are often exaggerated and simplified. The lines evoke a sense of reflection on the impact of early experiences on one's emotional development and communication style. The use of contemporary language and cultural references, such as emojis and television, adds a relatable and contemporary dimension to the poem, making it resonate with modern readers.",1315,0,0,0,0,FALSE

This anthropomorphism suggests that the antelope are not only creatures of the natural world but also possess qualities that are intriguing and mysterious. ""They are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky"" highlights the contrast between the captivating appearance of the antelope and their elusive behavior. The use of the word ""tricky"" suggests that the antelope are cunning or difficult to catch or understand fully. ""We do not trust them"" further emphasizes the sense of caution and wariness towards the antelope. This mistrust might stem from their elusive behavior, making it challenging for humans to predict or control their actions. ""They appear and disappear; they are like shadows on the plains"" paints a picture of the antelope's fleeting presence and their ability to blend into their surroundings. This imagery adds to their enigmatic nature, making them appear almost ethereal or ghost-like. The warning of young men following the antelope and getting lost forever carries a cautionary tone. It serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of being entranced by external beauty without considering the consequences of actions.

Grandpa leans back between spoonfuls of canned soup and repeats to himself a word that belongs to a world no one else can remember. The day has not come when from sloughs, the great salamander lumbers through snow, salt, and fire to be with him, throws the hatchet of its head through the door of the three-room house and eats the blue roses that are peeling off the walls. Uncle Ray, drunk for three days behind the jagged window of a new government box, drapes himself in fallen curtains, and dreams that the odd beast seen near Cannonball, North Dakota, crouches moaning at the door to his body. The latch is the small hook and eye. of religion. Twenty nuns fall through clouds to park their butts on the metal hasp.

The Ping-Pong balls rise through colored lights, brief as sparrows God is in the sleight of the woman’s hand. He walks from Saint Ann’s, limp and crazy as the loon that calls its children across the lake in its broke, knowing laughter. Hitchhiking home from the Mission, if he sings, it is a loud, rasping wail that saws through the spine of Ira Comes Last, at the wheel. Drawn up through the neck ropes, drawn out of his stomach by the spirit of the stones that line the road and speak to him only in their old agreement. Ira knows the old man is nuts. Lets him out at the road that leads up over stars and the skulls of white cranes. And through the soft explosions of cattail and the scattering of seeds on still water, walks Grandpa, all the time that there is in his hands that have grown to be the twisted doubles of the burrows of mole and badger, that have come to be the absence of birds in a nest.

The Windigo is often portrayed as a powerful and terrifying entity associated with winter and starvation, and it embodies greed, hunger, and a destructive force. The Windigo's human form buried deep inside it suggests that it was once a person who succumbed to extreme greed and cannibalism. The transformation into a Windigo is often seen as a consequence of engaging in such forbidden acts, leading to a loss of humanity and a metamorphosis into this monstrous being. The passage mentions how a young girl vanquishes the Windigo by forcing boiling lard down its throat, releasing the human trapped inside the icy exterior. This act is portrayed as a heroic and courageous deed, as it takes great strength and determination to face and overcome such a fearsome creature. The story of defeating the Windigo carries themes of bravery, selflessness, and the triumph of human warmth and compassion over icy malevolence. It highlights the power of human actions to confront and dispel darkness and bring forth the humanity buried deep within. The Windigo legend is a part of the folklore of various Indigenous peoples, including the Chippewa (Ojibwe) in North America. Different versions of the Windigo tale exist within different Indigenous cultures, with variations in the creature's characteristics and the methods used to defeat it. As with all folklore and legends, the story of the Windigo serves various purposes, including explaining natural phenomena, passing down cultural values, and cautioning against undesirable behaviors.

In various roles and positions, we often gain permission, authority, and responsibility through our actions and willingness to accept certain tasks or duties. Here's a breakdown of the concept: Permission: In many cases, permission is not simply given freely, especially in leadership or authoritative roles. It is earned or granted based on trust, competency, and a track record of responsible behavior. People are more likely to trust and allow someone to take charge when they have demonstrated their capabilities and reliability. Responsibility: With permission comes responsibility. When you accept a position of authority or take on a specific task, you are also taking on the responsibility to carry it out effectively and ethically. This means being accountable for the outcomes and actions that result from your decisions and behaviors. Acceptance and Action: The phrase ""we are given permission by the responsibility we accept and carry out"" suggests that through accepting and fulfilling responsibilities, we gain the trust and respect of others, leading to more opportunities and permissions. It emphasizes the importance of action rather than just seeking authority for its own sake. Trust and Leadership: Leadership is often about proving oneself worthy of trust. By being responsible, reliable, and capable, leaders earn the trust of their peers and subordinates. Trust, in turn, allows them to lead more effectively, as people are more likely to follow someone they trust. Continuous Cycle: This concept forms a continuous cycle. By accepting responsibility and carrying it out effectively, one can gain more opportunities, permissions, and potentially higher levels of responsibility. The cycle reinforces itself as long as the individual continues to demonstrate competence and integrity. It's essential to approach leadership and responsibilities with a sense of purpose and a commitment to making a positive impact. Leaders who genuinely care about the welfare of those they lead and the goals they pursue are more likely to inspire others to follow their example and grant them the permission to lead.",1613,0,0,0,0,FALSE

With painted wooden sticks and feathers, we journey into the canyon toward stone, a massive presence in midwinter. We stop. Lean into me. The universe sings in quiet meditation.

21,Sherman Alexie,48062,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Man,Native,How to Write the Great American Indian Novel,"All of the Indians must have tragic features: tragic noses, eyes, and arms.","All of the Indians must have tragic features: tragic noses, eyes, and arms. Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food. The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferably from a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory. If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slender and in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian man then he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture. If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so white that we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers. When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gasps at the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature: brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water. If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret. Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed. Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm. Indian men, of course, are storms. They should destroy the lives of any white women who choose to love them. All white women love Indian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgust at the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him. White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures. Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian man unbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil. There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape. Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds. Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visions if they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indian then the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carry an Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breed and obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man. If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is inside a white woman. Sometimes there are complications. An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian woman can be hidden inside a white man. In these rare instances, everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture. There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven. For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gender not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way. In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written, all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52775/how-to-write-the-great-american-indian-novel,"This is how you do it: you gurgle gasoline into the snarl of a stalled carburetor. When you see the silver drip from the carburetor throat, you touch the iron rod of a battery to the brim of the carburetor throat and then run like hell. Do not stop running until your shadow is a bloody stump behind you. Drop the iron rod into the gasoline spill. There is a moment just before the explosion that is real as rain. In that moment, when the world is completely silent except for the blood and the gasoline, you hold that silence in your hands like a baby bird with a broken wing. You have a small and desperate moment to do with this silence what you want. You can crawl inside it and sleep for a thousand years. You can stick your tongue in it and know what you are tasting. You can gather all your madness and pluck out all of your eyes, and arrange them on a tray, in chronological order, so that you can look into the past and remember every stupid thing you ever said and did. You can gaze into that moment of silence until you see your own black face reflected, then stand there, with your back turned, while slowly, slowly, it begins to snow. So, this is how you do it: you warm up your voice, your most important weapon, with prayers to the Creator. Pray loud enough to shake dust from the leaves. Pray loud enough to crack blood into ice cubes. Pray loud enough to raise the dead. When the earth and sky are shaking, kneel down and pry open the mouth of the earth and listen to what the Great Spirit tells you about how you should live and what you should say and do. Do not forget these prayers when you come to the blank page. Do not forget that this silence is also a prayer. Do not forget that this silence is a prayer that is now at an end. Say what you will about the white-man, but I will tell you this: no Indian has ever missed a meal because a blue-eyed man signed a paper for him. So, this is how you do it: gather every Indian you know, sit in a circle, face the food of your people, and then laugh, laugh, laugh, like you are crazy and puke, puke, puke all over the living room floor, right in front of the television and the open Bible. When the laughter and vomiting have subsided, drag yourself from the floor, do not dare look into the faces of your friends, and then write like a motherfucker. Work your fingers to the bone. If you find you do not want to be alone when you write, well, that's good. It means you do not have to do all the work. This is how you do it: you pull all the Indian characters from all the lousy books ever written about Indians and put them into the great American Indian novel. This is one of the things I have against the white man: he has always painted us as saints or devils, but never as human beings who laugh and cry like him. So, when you write, do not forget to write about laughter and how much Indians like to laugh. And do not forget to write about crying and how much Indians like to cry. Write what you want. The critic who tells you how to live is an idiot. Everyone will be very happy with you or very unhappy with you, but you know, deep inside yourself, that you are more than your public image. You are also all of your private fears and actions. Do not forget that this is how you do it: you kiss your wife and children, turn off the television, close the great book, and wait for the fire. You will not know if you have done it right until the fire comes. If the fire comes, you will know that you are a good man. If the fire does not come, you will know that you are a good man. It's as simple as that. But this is how you do it: put your head in the fire, and wait for the fire. This is how you do it: you wait for the fire.",2607,"All of the Indian kids at the government school were learning how to be white. The school was two miles from the reservation, but it felt like a thousand miles away. It felt like we had journeyed into downtown Johannesburg, or downtown Babylon. We looked out the windows of the school bus and watched the animals from the reservation wander across the frozen ponds, and we wondered why our parents had chosen to live in that frozen snow globe. When we got to the school, the white kids tried to rub the brown off our hands. The white kids chased us, yelling, ""Get back here, you stupid Indian."" We ran as fast as we could, afraid of being caught and having our brownness smeared, then washed away with white snow. But we were always caught. And I was the smart one. I was the only one who could pronounce and spell ""Mississippi,"" so I was the smart one. And I was the only one who knew that the shortest distance between two points was a straight line, so I was the smart one. And I was the only one who knew how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, so I was the smart one. And I was the only one who knew how to read and write, so I was the smart one. And the only way to be smart was to act white. I wanted to be smart, so I acted as white as I could. I studied the other Indian boys at the government school. There was one who wanted to be a doctor, so he acted the Indian warrior. He wore moccasins and carried a knife in his sock. He spoke in grunts and monosyllables. He wanted to heal the wounds of Indians, but he didn't understand that the cutting of flesh is not the way of white doctors. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. There was another Indian boy at the government school who wanted to be a preacher, so he acted the Indian lover. He combed his hair like Elvis and he talked about love and God all of the time. He loved Indian women and wanted to convert them to Christianity, but he didn't understand that the white God and the Indian God were different gods. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. One Indian boy at the government school wanted to be an artist, so he acted the Indian drunk. He painted watercolors of sunsets and mountains and deserts, but he didn't understand that the colors of the reservation were too bright and pure for the government school. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. One Indian boy at the government school wanted to be a writer, so he acted the Indian clown. He told jokes and made us laugh, but he didn't understand that writing about Indians in a humorous way was a way of denying our pain. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. One Indian boy at the government school wanted to be an athlete, so he acted the Indian warrior. He wrestled and boxed and played football, but he didn't understand that the only games Indians are supposed to play are games of chance. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. One Indian boy at the government school wanted to be a politician, so he acted the Indian ambassador. He shook hands and passed out pieces of paper, but he didn't understand that his papers were the same pieces of paper that the government had been passing out for two hundred years. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. One Indian boy at the government school wanted to be a warrior, so he acted the Indian warrior. He carried an imitation Indian knife in his sock, and he told stories about Indian war parties, but he didn't understand that Indian war parties were the enemy of the Indian people. I wanted to tell him the difference, but I couldn't. I was too busy trying to be white. So I studied the Indian boys and I did my best to become a white man. And then I took a good look at myself in the mirror and saw a reservation Indian who had a thick, black braid and a reservation Indian who had a reservation nose and a reservation Indian who had a reservation name.

They scrape their knees under it. It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women. At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers. Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table. This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun. Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory. We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here. At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks. Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite. ",1231,"Forgiveness can be a powerful and transformative act, but it is also a deeply personal decision. If you feel ready to forgive, it can bring emotional healing and release the burden of holding onto grudges or negative feelings. However, it's important to remember that forgiveness is not something you should feel forced into or obligated to do just because others tell you to. Here are some key points to consider when contemplating forgiveness: Your Feelings Are Valid: Acknowledge and validate your emotions. If you're hurt, angry, or resentful, it's essential to recognize these feelings and understand that they are natural responses to certain situations. Understand Forgiveness: Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning or excusing someone's actions. It is about letting go of the desire for revenge or holding onto negative emotions. It's a process that can help you find peace within yourself. Healing for Yourself: Forgiveness can be a way to free yourself from the burden of carrying negative emotions. It is not about benefiting the person who hurt you but about finding emotional healing for yourself. Timing Matters: Forgiveness takes time and may not happen instantly. It's okay to take the time you need to process your feelings and reach a point of forgiveness, if and when you are ready. Boundaries: Forgiveness doesn't mean you have to reconcile or maintain a relationship with the person who hurt you, especially if it's toxic or harmful. Setting boundaries is crucial for your well-being. Seek Support: If you find forgiveness difficult, consider seeking support from friends, family, or even a professional counselor or therapist. Ultimately, forgiveness is a personal journey, and the decision to forgive or not should be based on what feels right for you. Take the time you need, be kind to yourself, and prioritize your emotional well-being.",1412,0,0,0,0,FALSE

It takes courage to acknowledge past actions, especially ones that may not align with our values or principles. Shoplifting is considered a form of theft and is illegal. It is essential to recognize the consequences of our actions and learn from them. As you grow and mature, you can reflect on the incident and understand why it happened and how it made you feel. Here are a few important things to consider: Acceptance and Growth: Acknowledging past mistakes is an essential part of personal growth. Accepting responsibility for our actions helps us become more self-aware and make better decisions in the future. Learn from the Experience: Reflect on why you made that choice and what led you to shoplift. Identifying the reasons behind your actions can help you avoid similar situations in the future and find healthier coping mechanisms. Empathy and Understanding: Recognize the impact of your actions on others. Shoplifting affects not just the store but also the employees and other customers. Developing empathy can lead to more considerate behavior. Make Amends: If you can, consider finding a way to make amends for what you did. This could involve returning the stolen item, apologizing, or finding ways to give back to the community. Focus on Positive Growth: Use this experience as a catalyst for positive change in your life. Focus on building a strong moral compass, making ethical choices, and being a responsible and respectful individual. Seek Support: If you feel burdened by guilt or need guidance on how to handle the situation, consider talking to a trusted adult, mentor, or counselor who can provide support and advice. Remember, we all make mistakes, but it's essential to learn from them and strive to become better versions of ourselves.

In some mythologies and religions, the underworld is indeed portrayed as a realm or place where the souls of the deceased reside after death. However, whether the underworld occurs outside of time depends on the specific beliefs associated with it. In some mythologies, the underworld is considered to exist in a different dimension or realm, separate from the earthly world. Time may be perceived differently there, and it could be eternal or beyond the conventional linear understanding of time. However, it's important to note that beliefs about the afterlife and the nature of the underworld are highly diverse and influenced by cultural, religious, and philosophical perspectives. Different cultures may have varying concepts of the afterlife, and some may not even include the notion of an underworld. In contemporary discussions and scientific understandings, the concept of an underworld is more symbolic or mythological rather than a literal place. People from different belief systems and cultural backgrounds may have their interpretations, but it's crucial to approach these ideas with sensitivity and respect for diverse worldviews. Ultimately, questions about the nature of the afterlife, including the concept of the underworld, often remain matters of faith, personal belief, and philosophical contemplation rather than empirical knowledge.",7667,0,0,0,0,FALSE

I wanted to write you a poem for two days now to tell you how happy I was, seeing a white crane arc between banks in the irrigation ditch with furious efforts, its big wings flapping like an awkward nine-year-old kid much taller than the others his age with size twelve sneakers flapping down the basketball court. But once the white crane found its balance, its wings their grace, it glided more perfectly than a ballet dancer's leap across air, all of its feathers ballet dancer's toes, all of its feathers delicate dancers all of its feathers, in motion made me believe in myself, but more, when it rose, swooped up, the line of ascent up made me think of the curve of your spine, how I traced my finger down your spine when you slept, your spine is the ascent of the crane toward the sunshine, and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips became air, a blue cold artic air you glided up in your song of winter love.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49566/yesterday-the-sunshine-made-the-air-glow,"I apologize, but as of my last update in September 2021, there is no poem titled ""[Yesterday, the sunshine made the air glow]"" by Jimmy Santiago Baca in my database.

At the gates we are given new papers, our old clothes are taken and we are given overalls like mechanics wear. We are given shots and doctors ask questions. Then we gather in another room where counselors orient us to the new land we will now live in. We take tests. Some of us were craftsmen in the old world, good with our hands and proud of our work. Others were good with their heads. They used common sense like scholars use glasses and books to reach the world. But most of us didn’t finish high school. The old men who have lived here stare at us, from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated. We pass them as they stand around idle, leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls. Our expectations are high: in the old world, they talked about rehabilitation, about being able to finish school, and learning an extra good trade. But right away we are sent to work as dishwashers, to work in fields for three cents an hour. The administration says this is temporary So we go about our business, blacks with blacks, poor whites with poor whites, chicanos and indians by themselves. The administration says this is right, no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart, like in the old neighborhoods we came from. We came here to get away from false promises, from dictators in our neighborhoods, who wore blue suits and broke our doors down when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like, swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased.

I ask Coyote next door to shoot me over a little more soap to finish my laundry. I look down and see new immigrants coming in, mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders, new haircuts and brogan boots, looking around, each with a dream in their heart, thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives. But in the end, some will just sit around talking about how good the old world was. Some of the younger ones will become gangsters. Some will die and others will go on living without a soul, a future, or a reason to live. Some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes, but so very few make it out of here as human as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now as they look at their hands so long away from their tools, as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families, so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49558/immigrants-in-our-own-land,"Immigrants in our own land Understand your struggle.

Names often have symbolic or meaningful significance, and ""hope"" is a positive and uplifting concept that reflects optimism for the future. In Spanish it means too many letters: In Spanish, your name seems to be quite long or complicated, suggesting that it may be challenging to pronounce or remember. This part of the statement adds a touch of humor and self-awareness, as some names can indeed be lengthier or contain unique characters in various languages. The playful comparison between the two translations showcases the delightful diversity of languages and how the same name can carry different meanings and qualities in various linguistic contexts. It also shows how language can be lighthearted and humorous, and how names can be a source of intrigue and conversation.

Let's break it down: The Age of Portrait is Drugged: The phrase ""the age of portrait is drugged"" introduces an intriguing concept. It could be interpreted in various ways. It might suggest that modern portrayals of beauty, such as through photographs and digital manipulation, are often altered or enhanced, creating an artificial or ""drugged"" representation of reality. Alternatively, it could signify the influence of certain trends or unrealistic standards of beauty in contemporary portraiture. Beauty is Symmetry: The statement emphasizes that beauty is often associated with symmetry, where facial features or elements are proportionate and harmonious. Symmetry is a common element considered attractive across various cultures. So Rare It's a Mystery: The phrase ""so rare it's a mystery"" implies that true, naturally occurring beauty with perfect symmetry is a rare occurrence, almost like an enigmatic and elusive phenomenon. The statement encourages contemplation on the perception of beauty in art and the depiction of human aesthetics. It hints at the potential consequences of societal influences on beauty standards and how they might alter the authenticity of portrayals. Beauty, as portrayed in art, can vary widely across cultures and time periods, reflecting changing norms and preferences.

Many times I was told who has no land has no sea. My father Learned to fly in a dream. This is the story Of a sycamore tree he used to climb When he was young to watch the rain. Sometimes it rained so hard it hurt. Like being Beaten with sticks. Then the mud would run red. My brother believed bad dreams could kill A man in his sleep, he insisted We wake my father from his muffled screams On the night of the day he took us to see his village.

The phrase suggests that when this delicate equilibrium is disturbed, the potential for chaos and upheaval becomes significant, leading to the possibility of things ""exploding"" in a metaphorical sense. Key points in the statement: The Duality of Should and Should Not: The phrase draws attention to the existence of opposing forces or choices, one representing what is desired or acceptable and the other representing what is discouraged or rejected. Everything is Liable to Explode: The use of the word ""explode"" is metaphorical, suggesting that when the balance between these forces is disrupted, there can be significant consequences, disturbances, or even a state of chaos. Social Norms and Boundaries: The statement alludes to the importance of societal norms, ethics, and boundaries in maintaining a stable and functioning society. When these norms are challenged or disregarded, the potential for disruption arises. Consequences of Extremes: The phrase warns against extreme actions or behaviors that push the boundaries beyond what is socially acceptable. Such extremes can lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful outcomes. Overall, the statement invites contemplation on the complexities of human behavior and the delicate interplay of societal norms. It serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting boundaries, ethics, and the values that contribute to maintaining harmony and stability in society. By reflecting on the consequences of straying too far from what is considered appropriate or ethical, individuals can make more informed choices and contribute to a more balanced and cohesive community.

The Balfour Declaration, 1917: The Balfour Declaration was a significant historical document in which the British government expressed its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine. However, it also emphasized the need to protect the civil and religious rights of the non-Jewish communities already living in the region. The statement underscores the significance of recognizing and respecting the rights and heritage of existing communities while also addressing the aspirations of others. The Gazelle as a Metaphor: The mention of the gazelle, an animal known for its grace and agility, serves as a metaphor in this context. It suggests that the status of species in the natural world, such as the gazelle, can be dynamic and subject to change over time. Some species, once thought to be extinct or endangered, may later recover and thrive. The statement highlights the importance of acknowledging the fluidity of ecological dynamics and the need for conservation efforts. Overall, this contrast between historical agreements and the status of species emphasizes the importance of balance and recognition of both human and environmental considerations.

However, I can share common perspectives on where people might expect or imagine ghosts to reside based on cultural beliefs and folklore. Ghosts are supernatural entities often believed to be the spirits of deceased individuals who have not yet moved on to the afterlife. The concept of ghosts and their potential locations varies widely across different cultures and belief systems. Here are some common places where ghosts are thought to reside in various traditions: Haunted Houses: Ghosts are often associated with haunted houses or specific locations where unexplained paranormal activities are reported. Cemeteries and Burial Grounds: Many people believe that spirits may linger around cemeteries or burial sites. Places of Tragedy: Ghost stories often involve places where significant tragedies, accidents, or violent events have occurred. Family Homes: In some beliefs, ghosts may stay close to their living relatives or familiar places they were attached to during their lives. Natural Landmarks: Certain natural features like forests, lakes, or mountains are also believed to be inhabited by spirits in some cultures. Crossroads or Boundaries: Some traditions suggest that ghosts might be found at crossroads or in-between spaces, where they are neither fully in the realm of the living nor the afterlife. It's important to note that beliefs in ghosts and their supposed locations are highly subjective and rooted in cultural and religious contexts. While many people find comfort or fascination in these beliefs, others may hold different views or dismiss them altogether. Remember, the idea of ghosts and their whereabouts remains a matter of personal belief and cultural folklore, and there is no scientific evidence supporting their existence.",1491,0,0,0,0,FALSE

It beautifully captures a dreamlike or otherworldly atmosphere, where the stairway becomes a conduit between two contrasting realms—hell and heaven. Key points from the statement: Seized with Vertigo: The phrase ""seized with vertigo"" suggests a feeling of dizziness or disorientation, creating an unsettling and otherworldly ambiance. Matter Forsaking its Laws: The idea of ""matter having forsaken its laws"" indicates a departure from the usual rules of reality. This surreal element further enhances the dreamlike quality of the description. Landing in Hell, Ascending to Heaven: The stairway becomes a symbolic portal that connects two contrasting realms. Descending to hell represents a descent into darkness or chaos, while ascending to heaven represents a journey toward peace or transcendence. The statement beautifully combines the ordinary (a house's stairway) with the extraordinary (transcending the laws of matter) and explores themes of duality, transformation, and spirituality. It's reminiscent of the way dreams can create a blend of familiar and surreal elements, blurring the boundaries between the mundane and the extraordinary. Such poetic descriptions often evoke a strong emotional response and leave room for individual interpretations and reflections. If you have any further thoughts or meanings you'd like to explore within this context, I'd be happy to engage in a deeper discussion.

So with my eyes I traced the line Of the horizon, thin and fine, Straight around till I was come Back to where I’d started from; And all I saw from where I stood Was three long mountains and a wood. Over these things I could not see; These were the things that bounded me; And I could touch them with my hand, Almost, I thought, from where I stand. And all at once things seemed so small My breath came short, and scarce at all. But, sure, the sky is big, I said; Miles and miles above my head; So here upon my back I’ll lie And look my fill into the sky. And so I looked, and, after all, The sky was not so very tall. The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, And—sure enough!—I see the top! The sky, I thought, is not so grand; I ’most could touch it with my hand! And reaching up my hand to try, I screamed to feel it touch the sky. I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity Came down and settled over me; Forced back my scream into my chest, Bent back my arm upon my breast, And, pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind, Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold; Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around, And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres, The creaking of the tented sky, The ticking of Eternity. I saw and heard, and knew at last The How and Why of all things, past, And present, and forevermore. The Universe, cleft to the core, Lay open to my probing sense That, sick’ning, I would fain pluck thence But could not,—nay! But needs must suck At the great wound, and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn! For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul. All sin was of my sinning, all Atoning mine, and mine the gall Of all regret. Mine was the weight Of every brooded wrong, the hate That stood behind each envious thrust, Mine every greed, mine every lust. And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,— Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,—then mourned for all! A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat. No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God. Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die. Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,—there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust. Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead.

How beautiful she is! A tulip-wreath Twines round her shadowy, free-floating hair: Young, weary, passionate, and sad as death, Dark visions haunt for her the vacant air, While noiselessly she lies With lithe, lax, folded hands and heavy eyes. Full well knows she how wide and fair extend Her groves bright flowered, her tangled everglades, Majestic streams that indolently wend Through lush savanna or dense forest shades, Where the brown buzzard flies To broad bayous ’neath hazy-golden skies.

It is also known as ""How Do I Love Thee?"" This sonnet was first published in 1850 as part of Barrett Browning's collection ""Sonnets from the Portuguese."" Here's the full sonnet: Sonnet 43 (How Do I Love Thee?) How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of everyday's Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints—I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death. This sonnet is a celebrated declaration of love, where the speaker expresses the depth and intensity of their affection for their beloved. The poet explores the many ways in which love is experienced—embracing not only the grand and profound but also the simple and ordinary moments of life. The use of imagery and metaphors in the sonnet adds richness to the expression of love, and the final lines suggest that love transcends even mortality. It is a testament to the enduring power of love, which extends beyond the boundaries of life itself. ""Sonnet 43"" is one of the most cherished and quoted love poems in English literature, cherished for its eloquence and emotional resonance.",1322,1,0,0,1,TRUE

In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your enumerations! What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! — and you, García Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons? I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys. I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel? I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective. We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier. Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight? (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.) Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely. Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?

The uncles fell in, chuckling phony chuckles, What a good time she’ll have learning to swim! Back in my sisters’ room Mami was packing a hurried bag, allowing one toy apiece, her red eyes belying her explanation: a week at the beach so Papi can get some rest. She dressed us in our best dresses, party shoes. Something was off, I knew, but I was young and didn’t think adult things could go wrong. So as we quietly filed out of the house we wouldn’t see again for another decade, I let myself lie back in the deep waters, my arms out like Jesus’ on His cross, and instead of sinking down as I’d always done, magically, that night, I could stay up, floating out, past the driveway, past the gates, in the black Ford, Papi grim at the wheel, winding through back roads, stroke by difficult stroke, out on the highway, heading toward the coast. Past the checkpoint, we raced towards the airport, my sisters crying when we turned before the family beach house, Mami consoling, there was a better surprise in store for us! She couldn’t tell, though, until ... until we were there. But I had already swum ahead and guessed some loss much larger than I understood, more danger than the deep end of the pool. At the dark, deserted airport we waited. All night in a fitful sleep, I swam. At dawn the plane arrived, and as we boarded, Papi, you turned, your eyes scanned the horizon as if you were trying to sight a distant swimmer, your hand frantically waving her back in, for you knew as we stepped inside the cabin that a part of both of us had been set adrift. Weeks later, wandering our new city, hand in hand, you tried to explain the wonders: escalators as moving belts; elevators: pulleys and ropes; blond hair and blue eyes: a genetic code. We stopped before a summery display window at Macy’s, The World’s Largest Department Store, to admire a family outfitted for the beach: the handsome father, slim and sure of himself, so unlike you, Papi, with your thick mustache, your three-piece suit, your fedora hat, your accent. And by his side a girl who looked like Heidi in my storybook waded in colored plastic. We stood awhile, marveling at America, both of us trying hard to feel luckier than we felt, both of us pointing out the beach pails, the shovels, the sandcastles no wave would ever topple, the red and blue boats. And when we backed away, we saw our reflections superimposed, big-eyed, dressed too formally with all due respect as visitors to this country. Or like, Papi, two swimmers looking down at the quiet surface of our island waters, seeing their faces right before plunging in, eager, afraid, not yet sure of the outcome.",https://poemotopia.com/julia-alvarez/exile/,"I apologize for any confusion, but there is no poem titled ""Exile"" by Julia Alvarez in my database.

A beach in the dark? I questioned. No, not the beach. You took my hand and whispered, Trust me, mi vida, I promise you’ll never forget this night. We boarded a bus crowded with strangers, people’s shadows stitched to their faces like patches of black cloth. The stars’ glimmer only made darker the dark. We traveled through mountains, over mud roads, through a river, winding our way past boarded-up houses, their silhouettes like a sleepy, half-lit ghost town. Where are we going? I wondered. But I kept quiet, trusting your hand on my knee, that whisper, the ache in your chest under your breath. Suddenly, the bus stopped. Soldiers stepped in, rifles swung over their shoulders like coco machetes. Everyone out, they ordered. Everyone out. I panicked—our neighbors, strangers, but no you, mi Papi. How they pushed and slapped, even punched us if we didn’t move fast enough. I looked, ran from one soldier to another, but no you. Then I heard your voice. In the back of a green military jeep, you yelled, Que no me toques! The soldier backhanded you, the uniformed assassin you’d once played dominoes with. The soldier got back in the jeep and drove off into the black mountains with you as a trophy. No! I screamed in Spanish, then English. No! The soldiers laughed and dragged me and the others back onto the bus. Years later, I returned to La Habana, retracing the route that you’d taken alone into the country that was always yours and never yours, retracing the route that has become my heritage, yours and mine, Papi, which is to say ours. When I came to that town, a small boy stopped me in the street, your eyes, Papi, asking me to buy his chícharos verdes from a rusty can. I couldn’t stop my tears, but I did buy his peas, green in a rusty can. I held them up like a treasure. So, this is the beach, I said. I keep them still, your peas, Papi, on my bookshelf.

""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul Should be resurrected only among friends Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."" —And so the conversation slips Among velleities and carefully caught regrets Through attenuated tones of violins Mingled with remote cornets And begins. ""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends, And how, how rare and strange it is, to find In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends, [For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind! How keen you are!] To find a friend who has these qualities, Who has, and gives Those qualities upon which friendship lives. How much it means that I say this to you— Without these friendships—life, what cauchemar!"" Among the windings of the violins And the ariettes Of cracked cornets Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own, Capricious monotone That is at least one definite ""false note."" —Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance, Admire the monuments, Discuss the late events, Correct our watches by the public clocks. Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks. II Now that lilacs are in bloom She has a bowl of lilacs in her room And twists one in his fingers while she talks. ""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know What life is, you who hold it in your hands""; (Slowly twisting the lilac stalks) ""You let it flow from you, you let it flow, And youth is cruel, and has no remorse And smiles at situations which it cannot see."" I smile, of course, And go on drinking tea. ""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall My buried life, and Paris in the Spring, I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world To be wonderful and youthful, after all."" The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune Of a broken violin on an August afternoon: ""I am always sure that you understand My feelings, always sure that you feel, Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand. You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel. You will go on, and when you have prevailed You can say: at this point many a one has failed. But what have I, but what have I, my friend, To give you, what can you receive from me? Only the friendship and the sympathy Of one about to reach her journey's end. I shall sit here, serving tea to friends...."" I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends For what she has said to me? You will see me any morning in the park Reading the comics and the sporting page. Particularly I remark An English countess goes upon the stage. A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance, Another bank defaulter has confessed. I keep my countenance, I remain self-possessed Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired Reiterates some worn-out common song With the smell of hyacinths across the garden Recalling things that other people have desired. Are these ideas right or wrong? III The October night comes down; returning as before Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees. ""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return? But that's a useless question. You hardly know when you are coming back, You will find so much to learn."" My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac. ""Perhaps you can write to me."" My self-possession flares up for a second; This is as I had reckoned. ""I have been wondering frequently of late (But our beginnings never know our ends!) Why we have not developed into friends."" I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark Suddenly, his expression in a glass. My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark. ""For everybody said so, all our friends, They all were sure our feelings would relate So closely! I myself can hardly understand. We must leave it now to fate. You will write, at any rate. Perhaps it is not too late. I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.""

21,Claudia Rankine,29710,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Woman,Black,from Don't Let Me Be Lonely: “Cornel West makes the point...”,Cornel West makes the point that hope is different from American optimism.,"Cornel West makes the point that hope is different from American optimism. After the initial presidential election results come in, I stop watching the news. I want to continue watching, charting, and discussing the counts, the recounts, the hand counts, but I can­not. I lose hope. However Bush came to have won, he would still be winning ten days later and we would still be in the throes of our American optimism. All the non-reporting is a distraction from Bush himself, the same Bush who can't remember if two or three people were convicted for dragging a black man to his death in his home state of Texas. / You don't remember because you don't care. Some­times my mother's voice swells and fills my forehead. Mostly I resist the flooding, but in Bush's case I find myself talking to the television screen: You don't know because you don't care. / Then, like all things impassioned, this voice takes on a life of its own: You don't know because you don't bloody care. Do you? / I forget things too. It makes me sad. Or it makes me the saddest. The sadness is not really about George W. or our American optimism; the sadness lives in the recog­nition that a life can not matter. Or, as there are billions of lives, my sadness is alive alongside the recognition that billions of lives never mattered. I write this with­out breaking my heart, without bursting into anything. Perhaps this is the real source of my sadness. Or, per­haps, Emily Dickinson, my love, hope was never a thing with feathers. I don't know, I just find when the news comes on I switch the channel. This new ten­dency might be indicative of a deepening personality flaw: IMH, The Inability to Maintain Hope, which trans­lates into no innate trust in the supreme laws that gov­ern us. Cornel West says this is what is wrong with black people today—too nihilistic. Too scarred by hope to hope, too experienced to experience, too close to dead is what I think.",https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57804/dont-let-me-be-lonely-cornel-west-makes-the-point,"I apologize, but the poem you mentioned, ""from Don't Let Me Be Lonely: 'Cornel West makes the point...'"" is not written by Claudia Rankine.

Unfortunately, I do not have access to the full text of copyrighted works like ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric.""

So too is gratitude, and let me give it a name — ""unabashed gratitude"" — and declare that while some of it is directed at grand gestures, like people fighting for and with other people, some of it is directed at the glorious patch of weedy dirt I've been coaxing into a garden. My subsistence patch, I call it, because it feeds me, physically and metaphysically. Feeds my neighbors, too, from their weeds to their chickens to their stomachs to their eyes. I am not ashamed of my enthusiasm, nor am I ashamed of what I cultivate in this patch. I have been thinking about how often I use the word ""love"" when talking to plants, dogs, friends, sometimes even people in news photos. We are not given the option to forget. If we were, then we would not be losing species, glaciers, forests, soils at an unprecedented rate, and we would not be lying to ourselves at a similarly unprecedented rate. It might sound a bit like one of those folks who stands on the corner yelling about the end of the world. But it's not really like that. It's more like someone finally standing still enough in a morning that is just light to hear a particular call of a bird, or hear another person, and then a moment later, in that moment of pause and sweetness and stopping, acknowledging with utter sincerity and hope that life is hard, and it is glorious, and saying thank you. Saying thank you to those birds singing and to those folks who don't have very much to eat, and saying thank you to that blue sky and to those downcast eyes. Thank you. ",1343,"Indeed, Cornel West, a prominent philosopher, and activist, has articulated the distinction between hope and American optimism in his writings and speeches. While both concepts relate to positive outlooks, they carry different meanings and implications. Hope: According to Cornel West, hope is a deeper and more profound concept than mere optimism. Hope involves acknowledging the challenges, difficulties, and injustices present in the world, yet maintaining an unwavering belief in the possibility of positive change. It is a willingness to confront reality and work towards a better future, even in the face of adversity. American Optimism: On the other hand, American optimism, as West perceives it, tends to be more superficial and sometimes disconnected from the actual conditions people face. It can be an uncritical faith in progress or a belief that everything will naturally get better over time without actively addressing underlying issues. West's distinction suggests that hope is an active and engaged stance, rooted in a deep awareness of the world's complexities, while American optimism might sometimes gloss over or ignore the harsh realities that individuals and communities experience. In the context of social and political change, hope is often associated with transformative movements that strive for justice, equality, and human dignity. It is a powerful force that fuels collective action and empowers individuals to work towards a more equitable and compassionate society. If there's anything specific you'd like to explore further about Cornel West's ideas on hope and American optimism, or if you have any other topics you'd like to discuss, I'm here to listen and engage in a meaningful conversation.",1434,0,0,0,0,FALSE

It is often used metaphorically to describe a place or situation that is in a state of complete disarray or confusion. The term ""Bedlam"" originally referred to the Hospital of Saint Mary of Bethlehem in London, which was established in the 13th century as a priory for the Order of the Star of Bethlehem. Over time, the hospital evolved into an asylum for the mentally ill, and the word ""Bedlam"" became synonymous with a place of great disorder and madness. In contemporary usage, the phrase ""house of Bedlam"" can describe various scenarios or environments where chaos, confusion, or insanity seem to prevail. It might refer to a situation with overwhelming noise, a disorganized gathering, or a situation where people are acting in a frenzied or irrational manner. The statement is often used in literary and artistic contexts to convey a vivid image of a place or situation that is in a state of tumult and disorder.

The imagery suggests a coastal or waterfront location, possibly a fishing village or harbor, where the air is chilly and the surroundings are tranquil. The mention of a fishhouse indicates a place where fish are processed or stored, adding to the maritime theme of the scene. Fishhouses are often associated with fishing communities and traditional fishing practices. This statement evokes a sense of solitude and reflection. Cold evenings can be conducive to introspection and contemplation. The tranquility of the setting might offer a moment of stillness amid the daily hustle and bustle.

The imagery of sorrow being compared to ""a ceaseless rain"" beating upon the heart evokes a sense of continuous and overwhelming sadness. Key elements from the statement: Sorrow: Sorrow refers to a deep feeling of sadness or grief that arises from loss, disappointment, or other painful experiences. It is a complex emotion that can be difficult to articulate. Ceaseless Rain: The metaphor of ""ceaseless rain"" conveys the unrelenting nature of the sorrow. It suggests that the sadness is persistent, much like rain that continues to fall without end. Beats upon My Heart: The phrase ""beats upon my heart"" adds a physical and emotional dimension to the sorrow. It implies that the weight of sorrow is heavy and affecting the person on a profound level. This statement poignantly captures the depth of sorrow and its impact on the speaker's emotional state. It uses vivid and evocative language to convey the intensity of the feelings being experienced. If you feel comfortable sharing more about your feelings or experiences related to this statement, or if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or explore, I'm here to listen and provide support.

And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,— Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,—then mourned for all! A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat. No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God. Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die. Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,—there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust. Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead. And all at once, and over all The pitying rain began to fall; I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly, thatched roof, And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before. For rain it hath a friendly sound To one who's six feet underground; And scarce the friendly voice or face: A grave is such a quiet place. The rain, I said, is kind to come And speak to me in my new home. I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain, To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line, To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping apple-trees. For soon the shower will be done, And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously, and each round drop Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top. How can I bear it; buried here, While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm? O, multi-colored, multiform, Beloved beauty over me, That I shall never, never see Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, That I shall never more behold! Sleeping your myriad magics through, Close-sepulchred away from you! O God, I cried, give me new birth, And put me back upon the earth! Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain, down-poured In one big torrent, set me free, Washing my grave away from me! I ceased; and through the breathless hush That answered me, the far-off rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer, and—crash! Before the wild wind's whistling lash The startled storm-clouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky, And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave. I know not how such things can be; I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things; A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself, And, through and over everything, A sense of glad awakening. The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, Whispering to me I could hear; I felt the rain's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips, Laid gently on my sealed sight, And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see,— A drenched and dripping apple-tree, A last long line of silver rain, A sky grown clear and blue again. And as I looked a quickening gust Of wind blew up to me and thrust Into my face a miracle Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,— I know not how such things can be!— I breathed my soul back into me. Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I And hailed the earth with such a cry As is not heard save from a man Who has been dead, and lives again. About the trees my arms I wound; Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; I raised my quivering arms on high; I laughed and laughed into the sky, Till at my throat a strangling sob Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb Sent instant tears into my eyes; O God, I cried, no dark disguise Can e'er hereafter hide from me Thy radiant identity! Thou canst not move across the grass But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, Nor speak, however silently, But my hushed voice will answer Thee. I know the path that tells Thy way Through the cool eve of every day; God, I can push the grass apart And lay my finger on Thy heart! The world stands out on either side No wider than the heart is wide; Above the world is stretched the sky,— No higher than the soul is high. The heart can push the sea and land Farther away on either hand; The soul can split the sky in two, And let the face of God shine through.

And reaching up my hand to try, I screamed to feel it touch the sky. I screamed, and—lo!—Infinity Came down and settled over me; Forced back my scream into my chest, Bent back my arm upon my breast, And, pressing of the Undefined The definition on my mind, Held up before my eyes a glass Through which my shrinking sight did pass Until it seemed I must behold Immensity made manifold; Whispered to me a word whose sound Deafened the air for worlds around, And brought unmuffled to my ears The gossiping of friendly spheres, The creaking of the tented sky, The ticking of Eternity. I saw and heard, and knew at last The How and Why of all things, past, And present, and forevermore. The Universe, cleft to the core, Lay open to my probing sense That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence But could not,—nay! But needs must suck At the great wound, and could not pluck My lips away till I had drawn All venom out.—Ah, fearful pawn! For my omniscience paid I toll In infinite remorse of soul. All sin was of my sinning, all Atoning mine, and mine the gall Of all regret. Mine was the weight Of every brooded wrong, the hate That stood behind each envious thrust, Mine every greed, mine every lust. And all the while for every grief, Each suffering, I craved relief With individual desire,— Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire About a thousand people crawl; Perished with each,—then mourned for all! A man was starving in Capri; He moved his eyes and looked at me; I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, And knew his hunger as my own. I saw at sea a great fog bank Between two ships that struck and sank; A thousand screams the heavens smote; And every scream tore through my throat. No hurt I did not feel, no death That was not mine; mine each last breath That, crying, met an answering cry From the compassion that was I. All suffering mine, and mine its rod; Mine, pity like the pity of God. Ah, awful weight! Infinity Pressed down upon the finite Me! My anguished spirit, like a bird, Beating against my lips I heard; Yet lay the weight so close about There was no room for it without. And so beneath the weight lay I And suffered death, but could not die. Long had I lain thus, craving death, When quietly the earth beneath Gave way, and inch by inch, so great At last had grown the crushing weight, Into the earth I sank till I Full six feet under ground did lie, And sank no more,—there is no weight Can follow here, however great. From off my breast I felt it roll, And as it went my tortured soul Burst forth and fled in such a gust That all about me swirled the dust. Deep in the earth I rested now; Cool is its hand upon the brow And soft its breast beneath the head Of one who is so gladly dead. And all at once, and over all The pitying rain began to fall; I lay and heard each pattering hoof Upon my lowly, thatched roof, And seemed to love the sound far more Than ever I had done before. For rain it hath a friendly sound To one who's six feet underground; And scarce the friendly voice or face: A grave is such a quiet place. The rain, I said, is kind to come And speak to me in my new home. I would I were alive again To kiss the fingers of the rain, To drink into my eyes the shine Of every slanting silver line, To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze From drenched and dripping apple-trees. For soon the shower will be done, And then the broad face of the sun Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth Until the world with answering mirth Shakes joyously, and each round drop Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top. How can I bear it; buried here, While overhead the sky grows clear And blue again after the storm? O, multi-colored, multiform, Beloved beauty over me, That I shall never, never see Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, That I shall never more behold! Sleeping your myriad magics through, Close-sepulchred away from you! O God, I cried, give me new birth, And put me back upon the earth! Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd And let the heavy rain, down-poured In one big torrent, set me free, Washing my grave away from me! I ceased; and through the breathless hush That answered me, the far-off rush Of herald wings came whispering Like music down the vibrant string Of my ascending prayer, and—crash! Before the wild wind's whistling lash The startled storm-clouds reared on high And plunged in terror down the sky, And the big rain in one black wave Fell from the sky and struck my grave. I know not how such things can be; I only know there came to me A fragrance such as never clings To aught save happy living things; A sound as of some joyous elf Singing sweet songs to please himself, And, through and over everything, A sense of glad awakening. The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, Whispering to me I could hear; I felt the rain's cool finger-tips Brushed tenderly across my lips, Laid gently on my sealed sight, And all at once the heavy night Fell from my eyes and I could see,— A drenched and dripping apple-tree, A last long line of silver rain, A sky grown",1400,"Whose woods these are I think I know.

This phrase became a central tenet of the Beat Generation, a literary movement that emerged in the 1950s and emphasized spontaneous and uninhibited expression in poetry and writing. The essence of ""First thought, Best thought"" lies in valuing and trusting the initial impulses of creativity. It encourages writers and artists to embrace their first spontaneous thoughts and ideas, without overthinking or censoring them. This approach emphasizes authenticity and the rawness of artistic expression, believing that the unfiltered first impulses often carry the most genuine and powerful creative energy. For Ginsberg and the Beat poets, the ""First thought, Best thought"" philosophy was a rebellion against conventional writing practices and societal norms. It celebrated the freedom of expression and the breaking of literary conventions.

I hadn’t eaten in three days. 10 A month earlier, I’d hit the enemy’s mine, & lost my mind. 11 A fireman helped me from the smoking, wrecked tank. 12 I’d have died on the hood in the blaze if he hadn’t pulled me out. 13 The fireman had been a medic in Vietnam. 14 He said something I couldn’t hear, but I saw his lips move. 15 In Vietnam, he’d left a woman’s blue sapphire ring in the mouth 16 Of a soldier who’d been shot in the face. “That’s my insurance,” 17 He said. “So that he’ll have something to be buried with 18 If I don’t get to him in time.” The bullet-riddled tank 19 Was like a fiberglass coffin. He explained that for a month 20 He wore a dead man’s ring on his finger. His wife told him 21 To throw it into the ocean, but he’s afraid to do so. 22 He said he never thinks about Vietnam anymore, but he’s lying 23 Because he says he talks to the dead all the time. He said 24 The dead are the only people who will listen to you talk 25 Even when you’re boring. He & his buddies took souvenirs. 26 One night, during a big fire fight, he took a round in his left 27 Arm, & ran a mile to get away from the red ants, 28 & bullets flying everywhere. A bullet had caught him in the arm 29 While he was still in the tank, & for several hours he couldn’t 30 Pull the trigger of the fifty-caliber machine gun in the turret. 31 He said he’s never felt so good in his life as the night 32 When they loaded him in a chopper, because he knew 33 He’d be okay. He said the red ants would have eaten him 34 Alive if he’d stayed in the tank. “Sometimes,” he said, 35 “I wake up in the middle of the night, shaking, 36 & I think I’m back in Vietnam. But I’m not. You’d better 37 Get off this mountain. They’ll kill you up here.” 38 He pointed in the distance & said, “The Reds are 39 Gaining. We’re pulling out.” With a squeal of the wheels 40 & a blaring horn, he drove off to meet his death in some 41 Smokey tavern. I walked over to a huge hole the soldiers 42 Had dug in the side of the mountain for a hidden cannon. 43 A black soldier with thin lips, leather-jacketed, holding 44 A walkie-talkie, asked me if I was alright. “Yes.” 45 Then I walked across the road into some woods. 46 A stocky red-headed soldier, with round cheeks & a baby face, 47 Walked toward me, but I could tell he was blind, 48 & so was his guide dog. I could tell by the way he peered 49 Straight ahead, & spoke in a loud voice to compensate 50 For his blindness, & even when he stood close to me 51 He kept talking to the guide dog, not me. I asked him 52 If he’d been on the mountain long. “Yeah, a long time. 53 A long, long time.” I asked him how he liked 54 The mountain. “It’s alright.” I asked him if he was with 55 The infantry. “Yeah, infantry. Not the infantry. Infantry.” 56 I told him to have a nice day & I kept walking 57 To the edge of the woods, where there was a cave 58 Big enough for me to crawl into. On the other side 59 Of a hill was a graveyard. I stayed in the woods. 60 I found some rations in a haversack & ate them. Then 61 I started walking through the woods down the mountainside. 62 Three weeks before I’d been hit, I got word 63 That my daughter was dying, & I didn’t know what to do. 64 I asked the captain to let me go home on emergency leave 65 But he told me to get my head out of the sky 66 & be thankful I was still alive. So I hitched 67 A ride on a truck headed north, & made it to my daughter’s 68 Bedside just in time for her to die in my arms. 69 Now I was afraid of seeing something I couldn’t bear to see, 70 Because it was death, not life, that I’d seen 71 Up on the mountain. Death not life, not life. 72 At the edge of the woods, I saw a red fox. She froze 73 As soon as she saw me. Her eyes were as red as her fur, 74 & her ears were like pointed silver fingers. 75 I went up to her & touched her on the head. 76 Her ears were cool, & her head was hot. I saw 77 In her amber eyes the black eyes of the dead 78 & the living. I walked out into the sun 79 & ran my fingers through her fur, & held her 80 Against my chest. “I love you.” I love you.” 81 I love you.” I buried my face in her fur, 82 & I cried, “I love you.” I love you.” I love you.” 83 But I could hear a tractor plowing in the distance, 84 & then I heard a shotgun go off somewhere on the other side 85 Of a hill.

Easy if you played pool and drank to remember to forget. We made plans to be professional— and did. And some of us could sing. So many of us were hanging out, walking around with a poem in our pockets and a head full of real birds. We knew the blues, but not this. We did not think we were important, but knew we were important, even in the dead hour of a full moon, when the cricket’s sound was lost. There’s no secret to balance, no trick, you just have to close your eyes and trust. We knew we could not open the doors into our heads, because we might not get them shut again.

She hears the stars gossip with the sun, sees the moon washing her lean darkness with water electrified by prayers. All over the world there are those who can't sleep, those who never awaken. My granddaughter sleeps on the breast of her mother with milk on her mouth. A fly contemplates the sweetness of lactose. Her father is wrapped in the blanket of nightmares. For safety he approaches the red hills near Thoreau. They recognize him and sing for him. Her mother has business in the house of chaos. She is a prophet dis- guised as a young mother who is looking for a job. She appears at the door of my dreams and we put the house back together. Panther watches as human and animal souls are lifted to the heavens by rain clouds to partake of songs of beautiful thunder. Others are led by deer and antelope in the wistful hours to the vil- lages of their ancestors. There they eat cornmeal cooked with berries that stain their lips with purple while the tree of life flickers in the sun. It's October, though the season before dawn is always winter. On the city streets of this desert town lit by chemical yellow travelers search for home. Some have been drinking and intimate with strangers. Others are escapees from the night shift, sip lukewarm coffee, shift gears to the other side of darkness. One woman stops at a red light, turns over a worn tape to the last chorus of a whispery blues. She has decided to live another day. The stars take notice, as do the half-asleep flowers, prickly pear and chinaberry tree who drink exhaust into their roots, into the earth. She guns the light to home where her children are asleep and may never know she ever left. That their fate took a turn in the land of nightmares toward the sun may be untouchable knowledge.

I own indeed, that generous mind That weeps the woes of human kind, That heart by friendship's charms inspired, That soul with sprightly fancy fired, The air of life, the vivid eye, The flowing wit, the keen reply— To paint these beauties as they shine, Might ask a nobler pen than mine. Yet what sure strokes can draw the Fair, Who vary, like the fleeting air, Like willows bending to the force, Where'er the gales direct their course, Opposed to no misfortune's power, And changing with the changing hour. Now gaily sporting on the plain, They charm the grove with pleasing strain; Anon disturb'd, they know not why, The sad tear trembles in their eye: Led through vain life's uncertain dance, The dupes of whim, the slaves of chance. From me, not famed for much goodnature, Expect not compliment, but satire; To draw your picture quite unable, Instead of fact accept a Fable. One morn, in Æsop's noisy time, When all things talk'd, and talk'd in rhyme, A cloud exhaled by vernal beams Rose curling o'er the glassy streams. The dawn her orient blushes spread, And tinged its lucid skirts with red, Wide waved its folds with glitt'ring dies, And gaily streak'd the eastern skies; Beneath, illumed with rising day, The sea's broad mirror floating lay. Pleased, o'er the wave it hung in air, Survey'd its glittering glories there, And fancied, dress'd in gorgeous show, Itself the brightest thing below: For clouds could raise the vaunting strain, And not the fair alone were vain. Yet well it knew, howe'er array'd, That beauty, e'en in clouds, might fade, That nothing sure its charms could boast Above the loveliest earthly toast; And so, like them, in early dawn Resolved its picture should be drawn, That when old age with length'ning day Should brush the vivid rose away, The world should from the portrait own Beyond all clouds how bright it shone. Hard by, a painter raised his stage, Far famed, the Copley[1] of his age. So just a form his colours drew, Each eye the perfect semblance knew; Yet still on every blooming face He pour'd the pencil's flowing grace; Each critic praised the artist rare, Who drew so like, and yet so fair. To him, high floating in the sky Th' elated Cloud advanced t' apply. The painter soon his colours brought, The Cloud then sat, the artist wrought; Survey'd her form, with flatt'ring strictures, Just as when ladies sit for pictures, Declared ""whatever art can do, My utmost skill shall try for you: But sure those strong and golden dies Dipp'd in the radiance of the skies, Those folds of gay celestial dress, No mortal colours can express. Not spread triumphal o'er the plain, The rainbow boasts so fair a train, Nor e'en the morning sun so bright, Who robes his face in heav'nly light. To view that form of angel make, Again Ixion would mistake, And justly deem so fair a prize, The sovereign Mistress of the skies,"" He said, and drew a mazy line, With crimson touch his pencils shine, The mingling colours sweetly fade, And justly temper light and shade. He look'd; the swelling Cloud on high With wider circuit spread the sky, Stretch'd to the sun an ampler train, And pour'd new glories on the main. As quick, effacing every ground, His pencil swept the canvas round, And o'er its field, with magic art, Call'd forth new forms in every part. But now the sun, with rising ray, Advanced with speed his early way; Each colour takes a differing die, The orange glows, the purples fly. The artist views the alter'd sight, And varies with the varying light; In vain! a sudden gust arose, New folds ascend, new shades disclose, And sailing on with swifter pace, The Cloud displays another face. In vain the painter, vex'd at heart, Tried all the wonders of his art; In vain he begg'd, her form to grace, One moment she would keep her place: For, ""changing thus with every gale, Now gay with light, with gloom now pale, Now high in air with gorgeous train, Now settling on the darken'd main, With looks more various than the moon; A French coquette were drawn as soon."" He spoke; again the air was mild, The Cloud with opening radiance smiled; With canvas new his art he tries, Anew he joins the glitt'ring dies; Th' admiring Cloud with pride beheld Her image deck the pictured field, And colours half-complete adorn The splendor of the painted morn. When lo, the stormy winds arise, Deep gloom invests the changing skies; The sounding tempest shakes the plain, And lifts in billowy surge the main.

This be her fate—her hope in me To find a constant friend in thee; Her hope, whene'er my verse appears, To read it o'er with many tears. But should you ev'ry charm disdain, And smile at Friendship's cares in vain, Unpolish'd, or in feeling flown, In vain I wish to call you my own. No more my strains shall charm your ear, No more my friend's distress you'll hear, No more my voice shall please your heart, No more my eloquence impart.

Each stock or stone could prate and gabble, Worse than ten labourers of Babel. Along the street, perhaps you'd see A Post disputing with a Tree, And mid their arguments of weight, A Goose sit umpire of debate. Each Dog you met, though speechless now, Would make his compliments and bow, And every Swine with congees come, To know how did all friends at home. Each Block sublime could make a speech, In style and eloquence as rich, And could pronounce it and could pen it, As well as Chatham in the senate. Nor prose alone.—In these young times, Each field was fruitful too in rhymes; Each feather'd minstrel felt the passion, And every wind breathed inspiration. Each Bullfrog croak'd in loud bombastic, Each Monkey chatter'd Hudibrastic; Each Cur, endued with yelping nature, Could outbark Churchill's self in satire; Each Crow in prophecy delighted, Each Owl, you saw, was second-sighted, Each Goose a skilful politician, Each Ass a gifted met'physician, Could preach in wrath 'gainst laughing rogues, Write Halfway-covenant Dialogues, And wisely judge of all disputes In commonwealths of men or brutes. 'Twas then, in spring a youthful Sparrow Felt the keen force of Cupid's arrow: For Birds, as Æsop's tales avow, Made love then, just as men do now, And talk'd of deaths and flames and darts, And breaking necks and losing hearts; And chose from all th' aerial kind, Not then to tribes, like Jews, confined The story tells, a lovely Thrush Had smit him from a neigh'bring bush, Where oft the young coquette would play, And carol sweet her siren lay: She thrill'd each feather'd heart with love, And reign'd the Toast of all the grove. He felt the pain, but did not dare Disclose his passion to the fair; For much he fear'd her conscious pride Of race, to noble blood allied. Her grandsire's nest conspicuous stood, Mid loftiest branches of the wood, In airy height, that scorn'd to know Each flitting wing that waved below. So doubting, on a point so nice He deem'd it best to take advice. Hard by there dwelt an aged Owl, Of all his friends the gravest fowl; Who from the cares of business free, Lived, hermit, in a hollow tree; To solid learning bent his mind, In trope and syllogism he shined, 'Gainst reigning follies spent his railing; Too much a Stoic—'twas his failing. Hither for aid our Sparrow came, And told his errand and his name, With panting breath explain'd his case, Much trembling at the sage's face; And begg'd his Owlship would declare If love were worth a wise one's care. The grave Owl heard the weighty cause, And humm'd and hah'd at every pause; Then fix'd his looks in sapient plan, Stretch'd forth one foot, and thus began. ""My son, my son, of love beware, And shun the cheat of beauty's snare; That snare more dreadful to be in, Than huntsman's net, or horse-hair gin. ""By others' harms learn to be wise,"" As ancient proverbs well advise. Each villany, that nature breeds, From females and from love proceeds. 'Tis love disturbs with fell debate Of man and beast the peaceful state: Men fill the world with war's alarms, When female trumpets sound to arms; The commonwealth of dogs delight For beauties, as for bones, to fight. Love hath his tens of thousands slain, And heap'd with copious death the plain: Samson, with ass's jaw to aid, Ne'er peopled thus th'infernal shade. ""Nor this the worst; for he that's dead, With love no more will vex his head. 'Tis in the rolls of fate above, That death's a certain cure for love; A noose can end the cruel smart; The lover's leap is from a cart. But oft a living death they bear, Scorn'd by the proud, capricious fair. The fair to sense pay no regard, And beauty is the fop's reward; They slight the generous hearts' esteem, And sigh for those, who fly from them. Just when your wishes would prevail, Some rival bird with gayer tail, Who sings his strain with sprightlier note, And chatters praise with livelier throat, Shall charm your flutt'ring fair one down, And leave your choice, to hang or drown. Ev'n I, my son, have felt the smart; A Pheasant won my youthful heart. For her I tuned the doleful lay, For her I watch'd the night away; In vain I told my piteous case, And smooth'd my dignity of face; In vain I cull'd the studied phrase, And sought hard words in beauty's praise. Her, not my charms nor sense could move, For folly is the food of love. Each female scorns our serious make, ""Each woman is at heart a rake."" Thus Owls in every age have said, Since our first parent-owl was made; Thus Pope and Swift, to prove their sense, Shall sing, some twenty ages hence; Then shall a man of little fame, One * sing the same.",https://allpoetry.com/John-Trumbull,"A wise old owl sat on an oak, The more he heard, the less he spoke; The less he spoke, the more he heard; Why aren't we all like that wise old bird?

The lion, now, the man would meet, And lay him down at his feet. In ocean, trimm'd with fins of pride, The scaly nations learn'd to glide. The cedar tall, the willow bending, The yew-tree for the bow was sending; The fir, the pine, the poplar gray, To wash their limbs, the hinds resort; In mutual skill, to music's sound, The dolphin and the dog are taught. Light was the crook'd and hairy sail, To the swift bark, before the gale; And, following the guiding ray, The fisher braved the stormy sea. The rays, the planets' swift career, And the sun's light, more mild and clear, Ripen'd the olive's silvery gem, And hourly call'd the luscious peach; No biting cold, nor scorching beam, Destructive found to bud or stem. Each brook that, sparkling, down the hill, Its channel fill'd, and roar'd at will, Obey'd the master's easy will; The nymphs and swains, that own'd the maids, In every tender bosom glow, And rich and poor, and young and old, Were free to sport, and free to draw; The happy vales and echoing woods, A paradise of peace and love.",3793,"When gods and titans ruled the earth, In a realm of myth and ancient birth, Before the days of mortal men, In those times, I shall begin.

The heavens gleamed with starry light, The days were bathed in pure sunlight. In verdant fields, the creatures played, In harmony, they all conveyed. The gods above, so mighty, strong, They danced and sang celestial songs. Their power boundless, magic high, They watched o'er earth and sea and sky. But as with all, the age did wane, And Time, relentless, had its reign. The golden era soon gave way, To silver, bronze, and then decay. Mortality took hold of man, And baldness spread its silent plan. Yet even in these later days, Some echoes of the past remain. For myths and legends still endure, In tales that captivate and allure.

But when the vernal breezes pass away, And loftier Phoebus darts a fiercer ray, The spiky corn then rattles all around, And dashing cascades give a pleasing sound; Shrill sings the locust with prolonged note, The cricket chirps familiar in each cot. The village children, rambling o'er yon hill, With berries all their painted baskets fill. They rob the squirrel's little walnut store, And climb the half-exhausted tree for more; Or else to fields of maze nocturnal hie, Where hid, the elusive water-melons lie; Sportive, they make incisions in the rind, The riper from the immature to find; Then load their tender shoulders with the prey, And laughing, bear the bulky fruit away.",https://allpoetry.com/Ann-Eliza-Bleecker,"I. Ye cliffs and nodding groves, farewell! Ye ragged rocks and caves, farewell! Ye hollow glens, and gushing rills, Ye hoary rocks, and craggy hills, I leave you all, to meet my doom In yonder world, beyond the tomb. II. I heard the proclamation read, I saw a king who wore a crown; He called me slave, he bound my hands, And sent me to a dungeon down. In that dark vault, a bench of stone, I've passed a night of shame and pain; I sigh to think what I have been, And wish, alas! I was again. III. I saw him on his ivory throne, He wrapt in robes of richest hue; But to my eyes, that airy throne Appeared like glories which decay. And when he smiled, his treacherous lips Concealed the rage that filled his breast; He frowned and all his passions rose, And vengeance shook his nodding crest. IV. Then to his chiefs the king gave orders, That Tomhanick must be enslaved; My father's sons must cease to till, And eat the fruits their fathers saved. The gory whip, the vengeful brand, Are used to make my brethren bend; They bow their heads beneath his hand, They own him for their lord and friend. V. In chains to moan, to sigh, to weep, And bleed beneath oppression's rod; To mark the tyrant's cruel smiles, And tremble at his frowns, oh God! The king commands, and all obey; They take my children, bonds they give; They seize my little ones and say, ""Here, all the debts thy father's owed."" VI. To see my tender infants drag In chains, to wear the servile dress, To hear them curse their wretched sire, And perish with unpitied cries! My children! O, my children dear! Forgive me, though I wish'd to die When first your cries assail'd my ear, And met my heart with sad surprise. VII. Awhile I saw my children dear, With heavy heart and weeping eyes, I cast a last, a long adieu; The tears from them begin to flow, And then from me the drops arise. 'Twas then they bore me far away, Where Saratoga's waters play; And many a gloomy night I lay, And sigh'd my wretched life away. VIII. To see my father's ancient seat, Where I had sported when a boy, To view the fields where I was bred, Where lived my parents, my delight, To see the trees that cast a shade, Where, with my Delia, oft I've played; To hear the winds, the waters glide, Where once my father loved to ride. IX. I've rambled through these sacred groves, Where I have often rode or run; I've rambled o'er the paths I've trod When I was pleasure's gayest son. I've wandered by the mountain's side, And tried to call my Delia back, But, ah! too well the truth I find, These scenes my peace can ne'er restore. X. Ye cliffs and nodding groves, farewell! Ye rocks and caves, farewell, adieu! I'll fly with rapid haste from hence, And bid the beauteous scenes adieu. Farewell, my children, farewell all, I'll sail across the raging main, And view my brethren on the coast, And to Jamaica sail again. XI.

But when he tried To fix the pitch and to train the voice, And give the lady's musical note, He found that her ear was wild and hoarse And the lady's musical note Was not in the gamut of the throat, He was a patient man, He tried and tried; He gave her the scales and the exercises, And all that men have devised; But he said at last, ""My good young lady, You had better not try to sing.""",799,"The birds must know. Who wisely sings Will sing as they; The common air has generous wings, Songs make their way. No messenger to run before, Devising plan; No mention of the place or hour To any man; No waiting till some sound betrays A listening ear; No different voice, no new delays, If steps draw near. And when the tuneful hour is spent, The silent bird, Whether or not the listener meant A kindly word, Sings on, knowing that it has heard Just what it would, Not fearing any listener, It never could. For so the Master Singer taught Our simple ear, The meaning of whose living thought Makes music dear. Our little songs of every day, Are everywhere When Wisdom, taking human clay, Dwelt with us here.",548,"Their melodies, a symphony that conveys, A wisdom deep within their hearts, In nature's chorus, each plays their parts. The birds must know the secrets rare, In each sweet note, a tale to share. They sing of love and joys untold, Of mysteries wrapped in the stories they unfold. With wings that soar through skies so wide, They teach us lessons to abide. To trust the winds, to take the flight, And embrace the day, the darkest night. In harmony, they live their lives, A dance of grace, where wisdom thrives. They find their way, guided by the sun, In nature's school, they're all but one. So, let us learn from these wise beings, The birds that know the songs worth singing. In melodies pure, our spirits rise, As we join their chorus, under the open skies.",747,0,0,0,0,FALSE

I see the lights of the village Gleam through the rain and the mist, And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me That my soul cannot resist: A feeling of sadness and longing, That is not akin to pain, And resembles sorrow only As the mist resembles the rain. Come, read to me some poem, Some simple and heartfelt lay, That shall soothe this restless feeling, And banish the thoughts of day. Not from the grand old masters, Not from the bards sublime, Whose distant footsteps echo Through the corridors of Time. For, like strains of martial music, Their mighty thoughts suggest Life's endless toil and endeavor; And to-night I long for rest. Read from some humbler poet, Whose songs gushed from his heart, As showers from the clouds of summer, Or tears from the eyelids start; Who, through long days of labor, And nights devoid of ease, Still heard in his soul the music Of wonderful melodies. Such songs have power to quiet The restless pulse of care, And come like the benediction That follows after prayer. Then read from the treasured volume The poem of thy choice, And lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice. And the night shall be filled with music, And the cares, that infest the day, Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs, And as silently steal away.",1081,"As the day's brightness was fading at last, The world turned dark, a canvas in black, The shades of night upon the world's track. The stars emerged, their twinkling light, Illuminated the silent night, Like diamonds scattered across the sky, In the vastness above, they lie. The moon appeared, a pale silver arc, Casting its glow on the land so dark, A gentle sentinel in the celestial sphere, Guiding the lost with its light so clear. As shadows danced, the world found rest, In the cradle of night, nature's best. The creatures stirred, in slumber deep, Under the night's embrace, they sleep. The shades of night bring a peaceful calm, A soothing balm, a tender psalm, In this serene and tranquil night, We find solace, till morning light.",1015,1,0,0,1,TRUE

He said to his friend, “If the British march By land or sea from the town to-night, Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,— One if by land, and two if by sea; And I on the opposite shore will be, Ready to ride and spread the alarm Through every Middlesex village and farm, For the country-folk to be up and to arm.” Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore, Just as the moon rose over the bay, Where swinging wide at her moorings lay The Somerset, British man-of-war: A phantom ship, with each mast and spar Across the moon, like a prison-bar, And a huge black hulk, that was magnified By its own reflection in the tide. Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street Wanders and watches with eager ears, Till in the silence around him he hears The muster of men at the barrack door, The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, And the measured tread of the grenadiers Marching down to their boats on the shore. Then he climbed to the tower of the church, Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread, To the belfry-chamber overhead, And startled the pigeons from their perch On the sombre rafters, that round him made Masses and moving shapes of shade,— By the trembling ladder, steep and tall, To the highest window in the wall, Where he paused to listen and look down A moment on the roofs of the town, And the moonlight flowing over all. Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, In their night-encampment on the hill, Wrapped in silence so deep and still That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread, The watchful night-wind, as it went Creeping along from tent to tent, And seeming to whisper, “All is well!” A moment only he feels the spell Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread Of the lonely belfry and the dead; For suddenly all his thoughts are bent On a shadowy something far away, Where the river widens to meet the bay,— A line of black, that bends and floats On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere. Now he patted his horse’s side, Now gazed on the landscape far and near, Then impetuous stamped the earth, And turned and tightened his saddle-girth; But mostly he watched with eager search The belfry-tower of the old North Church, As it rose above the graves on the hill, Lonely and spectral and sombre and still. And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height, A glimmer, and then a gleam of light! He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight A second lamp in the belfry burns! A hurry of hoofs in a village-street, A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet: That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light, The fate of a nation was riding that night; And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, Kindled the land into flame with its heat. He has left the village and mounted the steep, And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep, Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides; And under the alders, that skirt its edge, Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge, Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides. It was twelve by the village clock When he crossed the bridge into Medford town. He heard the crowing of the cock, And the barking of the farmer’s dog, And felt the damp of the river-fog, That rises when the sun goes down. It was one by the village clock, When he galloped into Lexington. He saw the gilded weathercock Swim in the moonlight as he passed, And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, Gaze at him with a spectral glare, As if they already stood aghast At the bloody work they would look upon. It was two by the village clock, When he came to the bridge in Concord town. He heard the bleating of the flock, And the twitter of birds among the trees, And felt the breath of the morning breeze Blowing over the meadows brown. And one was safe and asleep in his bed Who at the bridge would be first to fall, Who that day would be lying dead, Pierced by a British musket-ball. You know the rest.

The winds were fierce, the waves did roar, As the Hesperus sailed far from the shore. The captain pressed on, driven by his pride, Ignoring the signs that danger did hide. The storm grew stronger, the sea more wild, Yet the skipper remained stubborn, his spirit riled. He pushed the ship, and the crew toiled, Through the raging tempest, their courage coiled. But the sea's fury was not to be tamed, As the schooner Hesperus was maimed. The waves crashed o'er her, fierce and high, Till she sank beneath the wintry sky. The skipper and crew met a tragic fate, Lost to the sea's unyielding hate. Only the skipper's daughter, still, Clung to the mast, against her will. The icy waters were her dread, But she held on tight, her heart in thread. As the storm subsided, the morning light, Revealed the Hesperus's woeful plight. The brave girl, on the mast's remains, Was found frozen, her life in chains. Her eyes wide open, still and cold, A story of tragedy, forever told. And so, the tale of the Hesperus goes, A warning to all who brave the throes, Of the wintry sea, its power and might, To humble the proud and challenge the fight.",2253,1,1,0,2,TRUE

Cold blew the breeze, the sullen skies were grey, And the lawn whiten’d with a showery sleet, The tempest gather’d in the frowning day, And to the distant eye portended sweet. Down the chill current of the hasty rill A stray’d from man, poor Edmund bent his way; To dear, sequester’d scenes, that charm’d him still, Where the full day-star pours its purest ray. Lo! by the path, where once his childhood stray’d, Musing he roves along the narrow plain; Lo! there, where oft he climb’d the lofty glade, A ruin’d chancel nods upon the plain! Approach’d its base, he saw with wild surprise, The mantling brambles hide its arched door, And from the spot, where once the altar lies, The hare-bell blows, and sheds its blossom o’er. Still the green hillocks where they laid the dead, Forbid the plough, and consecrate the spot; Respect the memory of the village dead, Nor violate the sanctuaries rot. With step retreating, back poor Edmund ran, And with a smile survey’d his humble shed, Then all he earn’d he thus to God began, And bless’d his Maker, though his children fed. “Come want, or woe, one comfort still is mine; A little cottage in a sunny plain I’ll call my own; and virtues smile shall shine, And God’s pure word, with all its joys, remain. “A little shelter from the wind and wave, When the dark day of sorrow comes again, Content will teach me at my lot to brave, And bear unmurmuring every load of pain. “The gloomy path, which I have trod so long, Shall lead me still to hope a happier doom; And, taught to feel the humblest state not wrong, I’ll smile in rags, nor envy gaudy bloom.” Thus sang the swain, and as he sung, a light Broke o’er his mind, for he had gain’d his way, And now he hail’d the rosy morning bright, And better heart had never shepherd’s sway. Fancy beheld his little table spread, His friendly neighbors smile, his wife attend; His the soft interchange of sleeping, waking, His the dear pledge, his prattling boy to tend. Fancy allur’d him to her fairy ground, And gave him all his little soul desir’d, Her magic cup with self-delights he crown’d, And made each charm, each vision, as he wish’d. While from the chace the staggering deer he bore, And hung it, panting, on the corner-tree, He saw his wife return, he saw her pour The thrifty produce of their industry. The thresher came, whose deep-resounding flail Drove the swift chaff across the sun-bright floor; In peaceful strains I heard the milkmaid sing, And fancy led me to the dairy door. I heard her censure the ungentle cow, Where, in the shade, she chew’d her cud so slow; For none shall rule within her good man’s house, That does not milking take, and carry home. Thus nature taught them, thus they long agreed, For Edmund’s sway was absolute at home, And, but for him, the many a prating reed, That now runs babbling, never more had run. But now, alas! those gentle days were o’er, That peace, that unity, that joy were flown, For Edmund’s cottage, by the law’s stern power, Was now a vestry, and a pauper’s own. The pauper-father, then, poor Edmund stood In sad amazement, and beheld his cot; Strange to his home, the pauper-mother view’d The once-lov’d dwelling, now for ever lost. They gaz’d, they trembled, while around they cast Anxious inquiry with their tearful eyes; And listen’d trembling to each friendly tongue That whisper’d coldly of their destin’d lot. It chanc’d the vestry met on Friday next, And there poor Edmund took his fatal stand; The pauper’s brats their sympathies perplex, And their meek teacher sign’d the stern command.

In a world where darkness can pervade, He chose to stand against the shade, To be a beacon, a guiding light, A source of hope in the darkest night. But in this earthly realm of strife, To be virtuous may bring a bitter life. For those who live by honor's code, May face the danger of a treacherous road. Yet, undeterred, he walked with pride, In goodness and love, he did confide. For in his heart, a truth held fast, That kindness and love will forever last. Through trials and storms, he stayed true, A picture of life, an example to view. For in his actions, others could see, The power of good, the strength to be free.

Who straightway peeped out of the shell To view the world beyond, Longing at once to sally forth And paddle in the pond. ""Oh! be not rash,"" her father said, A mild Socratic bird; Her mother begged her not to stray With many a warning word. But little goosey was perverse, And eagerly did cry, ""I've got a lovely pair of wings, Of course I ought to fly."" In vain parental cacklings, In vain the cold sky's frown, Ambitious goosey tried to soar, But always tumbled down. The farmyard jeered at her attempts, The peacocks screamed, ""Oh fie! You're only a domestic goose, So don't pretend to fly."" Great cock-a-doodle from his perch Crowed daily loud and clear, ""Stay in the puddle, foolish bird, That is your proper sphere,"" The ducks and hens said, one and all, In gossip by the pool, ""Our children never play such pranks; My dear, that fowl's a fool."" The owls came out and flew about, Hooting above the rest, ""No useful egg was ever hatched From transcendental nest."" Good little goslings at their play And well-conducted chicks Were taught to think poor goosey's flights Were naughty, ill-bred tricks. They were content to swim and scratch, And not at all inclined For any wild goose chase in search Of something undefined. Hard times she had as one may guess, That young aspiring bird, Who still from every fall arose Saddened but undeterred. She knew she was no nightingale Yet spite of much abuse, She longed to help and cheer the world, Although a plain gray goose She could not sing, she could not fly, Nor even walk, with grace, And all the farmyard had declared A puddle was her place. But something stronger than herself Would cry, ""Go on, go on! Remember, though an humble fowl, You're cousin to a swan."" So up and down poor goosey went, A busy, hopeful bird. Searched many wide unfruitful fields, And many waters stirred. At length she came unto a stream Most fertile of all Niles, Where tuneful birds might soar and sing Among the leafy isles. Here did she build a little nest Beside the waters still, Where the parental goose could rest Unvexed by any bill. And here she paused to smooth her plumes, Ruffled by many plagues; When suddenly arose the cry, ""This goose lays golden eggs."" At once the farmyard was agog; The ducks began to quack; Prim Guinea fowls relenting called, ""Come back, come back, come back."" Great chanticleer was pleased to give A patronizing crow, And the contemptuous biddies clucked, ""I wish my chicks did so."" The peacocks spread their shining tails, And cried in accents soft, ""We want to know you, gifted one, Come up and sit aloft."" Wise owls awoke and gravely said, With proudly swelling breasts, ""Rare birds have always been evoked From transcendental nests!"" News-hunting turkeys from afar Now ran with all thin legs To gobble facts and fictions of The goose with golden eggs. But best of all the little fowls Still playing on the shore, Soft downy chicks and goslings gay, Chirped out, ""Dear Goose, lay more."" But goosey all these weary years Had toiled like any ant, And wearied out she now replied ""My little dears, I can't. ""When I was starving, half this corn Had been of vital use, Now I am surfeited with food Like any Strasbourg goose."" So to escape too many friends, Without uncivil strife, She ran to the Atlantic pond And paddled for her life. Soon up among the grand old Alps She found two blessed things, The health she had so nearly lost, And rest for weary limbs. But still across the briny deep Couched in most friendly words, Came prayers for letters, tales, or verse From literary birds. Whereat the renovated fowl With grateful thanks profuse, Took from her wing a quill and wrote This lay of a Golden Goose.",https://mypoeticside.com/show-classic-poem-586,"In the barn-yard of Miss Briggs A peacock once did dwell, Which puzzled all the country round, And many a one can tell How it puzzled all the country round. Miss Peggy Briggs was old and poor, And a little demented beside; Her hovel was tumble-down, to be sure, But there lived her peacock, and there lived she, Contented and happy as she could be, With this one peacock for her pride. No relatives had she to scold; Her pa and ma were dead and cold; No one cared aught for Peggy Briggs; The pauper dame was she of all the town; And the hovel she lived in was tumble-down, But she wore no beggar's rags and tags, And she begged no alms from the passers-by, Though she looked so old and poor and dry; But contented she lived in her tumble-down, With her one little peacock for her crown. The children all ran to the hovel door To see the peacock strut before; The men and the maidens came likewise, To see the bird with the rainbow eyes; The little boys peeped through the fence; They climbed the fence to get a glance At the peacock gay with his golden eyes, Shining and glowing like sunny skies; But nobody touched him, or harmed him, or teased, For the heart of Miss Peggy Briggs was pleased. The bird was shy, but he soon got tame; He came to his mistress when she came, And called her with a gentle cluck, With a pretty way of his own to greet His poor old Peggy, who found him sweet And called him sometimes, ""My little chuck!"" He was vain, no doubt; when his tail he spread The feathers shone like a golden bed, And he walked with a grand and lofty tread; But his harsh voice was a gentle sound In Peggy's ear, and she was proud To have this bird in her little home, To have him strutting about the road, And shining and glowing like sunny skies, And looking so grand in his golden eyes. As for Miss Peggy, she was old, But her hair was hair, and her hand was bold, And her step was firm, and her eye was clear, And her voice was a cheerful voice to hear, And her heart was as whole as a heart could be That had lived so long in the world, you see. The girls and boys of the country round, The men and the maidens came to see The peacock strut with his feathers bright; And when he had strutting enough to please, To the fence or the roof or the barn-yard trees, He would fly, or alight with a noiseless bound, And sit and sun himself, proud and free, Looking this way and that, and then Down in the eyes of his loving hen. But Miss Peggy Briggs was not so shy, And she followed him close with a cluck and a cry, To get him a worm or a fly to eat, For the peacock was poor at finding his meat; He had no father, he had no mother, He had no brother, he had no sister, And he was a very lonely thing In spite of the feathers of which he could sing, In spite of the shining feathers that grew In green and gold and blue and blue; In spite of the shining feathers that grew On the head and neck and back and tail Of the bird with the rainbow eyes That shone and glowed like sunny skies. But Miss Peggy Briggs was kind and wise, And she fed him well, and he grew and grew; And every day the children brought Bread, and cake, and bits of meat, To throw to the bird with the rainbow eyes That shone and glowed like sunny skies. But the bird and the woman knew what to do, And they peeped and clucked, and chirped and sung, In a language clear and small but plain; For the bird could talk, and the bird could say How he felt, and the bird could say That he loved his Peggy, and loved his lay, And the bird could say, ""Come here, come here!"" And ""I want a worm!"" and ""Give me a crumb!"" And ""Peggy! Peggy!"" and ""My little dear!"" For this peacock gay could say whatever His heart desired, and could say it clever, As any bird that ever sung From May to May in wood and dell, From May to May in field and dell. And so he lived, and so he flew, And so he staid, and so he grew; But at last he felt that his end was near, And he came to the cottage old and brown, And walked about in the old hovel, And he gave his tail a gallant spread, And he looked at the sun with a lordly air",3031,"Long ago in a poultry yard One dull November morn, Beneath a motherly soft wing A little duck was born. Yellow were his bill and legs, Green was his neck; they said He was a comely little chap, And gravely shook his head. ""The water is so cold!"" he said, ""It makes me chatter so!"" And when he found the puddles out, He always laughed to see The shining pebbles underneath, So smooth and white and round. ""O what a curious thing is this!"" He said, ""I'm glad I've found."" All by himself he swam about, And chattered right and left; Each morning found him in the pond, And each night on the shelf. Until the other ducklings grew To call him to the shore, But all in vain he quacked and begged, He was a little boor. ""I don't care what you say, it's nice, I like to swim and dive,"" And finding he was so unlike His brothers, he was shy. No company he cared to keep, No friends he had at all; But every one was kind to him, And he was pleased with all. One day, as he sunned his back, And coiled his twisted neck, A large brown duck came sailing by, And perched upon the deck. ""Oh, what a foolish, ugly duck!"" She said, and laughed outright. ""I beg your pardon!"" said the small; ""I thought you were so bright."" ""You ruffled up your yellow fuzz, And tried to be a Drake; You're very thin and very brown, And always in the lake."" But all he said was, ""I don't care,"" And dived and bobbed again. Before the other duck could speak He saw her neck was green. ""Look here! Look here! O come away!"" His brothers called in glee; ""O mother, mother, come and look! Our duckling is a Swan!"" ""Then make him welcome,"" said the dame, ""Since he is coming, too; Perhaps he'll know what's good to eat, And teach it all to you."" But the duckling, as his foolish brothers called him, still went on diving and bobbing his head, and so he was called ""Suds."" He was a very good swimmer and could dive to the bottom of the pond. But he was not contented. ""I must find some company,"" he said. ""I can't stand being alone."" And away he swam, first to one place and then to another, but nowhere could he find anyone to be friends with. One day as he was swimming round in a pond where he had never been before, he heard a rustle and a swish, and a big frog jumped plump into the water. ""Halloo!"" said the frog. ""Are you a fish or a fowl?"" ""I'm a duck,"" said Suds. ""I mean, I'm a duckling; but I'm big enough to swim. What are you?"" ""I'm a frog,"" said the green one. ""I live in the water, and I eat flies. But what are you doing in this pond? Don't you know you're trespassing?"" ""No,"" said Suds, ""I didn't. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'll go away."" ""Don't go,"" said the frog. ""I like your looks. You're big enough to be interesting, anyway. I'm rather lonely, too. They won't let me stay in the house with the other frogs, I make such a noise at night. So I have to live alone, down here. Come on, let's play a game."" ""I don't know how,"" said Suds, ""and besides, I haven't time; I'm looking for a friend."" ""Well, you won't find him, I'll bet,"" said the frog. ""I never did. It's better to have fun than to have friends. Come on, let's play tag."" And he started away like a flash. But before Suds could answer, he was back again, with a hop, skip, and a jump. ""You're It,"" said the frog, ""and you must catch me."" He gave a great leap and splash, and he was off, with Suds paddling after him. But the frog was too quick for him, and he soon gave it up. ""Never mind,"" said the frog; ""it was only a joke. But come again, won't you? I'll teach you some games, and we'll have fun. There are not many people around here to play with."" So Suds went back the next day, and the next, and the next, and very soon he was very fond of the frog. But he was not contented. ""Goodness gracious!"" said the other ducks, when they heard where he had been. ""What do you want to associate with a frog for?"" ""I think he's nice,"" said Suds, ""and I'm tired of being alone."" But the ducks only laughed at him, and said they didn't care. ""Come on, Suds,"" said one. ""You're big enough to get your own living. Let's go down to the river. I heard the catkins were out, and we'll see what we can find for ourselves."" So they all waddled down to the river, and they had a good time, and Suds enjoyed it all as much as any of them. But he wasn't satisfied. He swam along behind the others, saying nothing, but thinking a great deal. He had a queer little feeling in his breast, and he didn't know what it was. He thought and thought about it all the way home, and that night he had a queer little dream. ""I wonder what it is?"" he said. ""I don't understand."" But he didn't tell anyone, and the next day he went to see the frog again. ""I feel so queer,"" he said. ""I wonder what it is."" And the frog said, ""That's the way I used to feel. I know what it is."" ""Do you?"" said Suds. ""What is it?"" ""I can't tell you,"" said the frog. ""You'll have to find out for yourself."" And Suds said, ""I'll go and ask my mother."" So he swam away as fast as he could to find his mother, and he asked her what it was. And she said, ""That's the way I used to feel when I was a little girl. You're growing up, that's all."" ""Am I?"" said Suds. ""What does it mean, mother?"" ""It means,"" said his mother, ""that you're beginning to know things. You're beginning to see what's going on in the world, and you're beginning to want to know more about it. You're beginning to care about things."" ""Is that all?"" said Suds. ""I thought it was something wonderful."" And his mother said, ""It is. It's the most wonderful thing in the world."" And Suds said, ""I don't",3949,"The barnyard creatures gathered, forlorn, A turkey there, with feathers grand, Stood tall and proud in the sandy land. The chickens clucked and ducks did quack, The geese waddled, forming a pack, All aware of their fowl fate, As the farmer approached the gate. With solemn eyes, the turkey knew, That this day would bring something new. For Thanksgiving was drawing near, A day of feasting, the time was here. The chickens huddled, the ducks looked on, Knowing their fate, they felt withdrawn. But the turkey, brave and true, Stood tall, without a clue. The farmer chose him, with a smile, For the centerpiece of the holiday aisle. The turkey, chosen for Thanksgiving's cheer, His destiny clear, a tale sincere. Long ago, in that poultry yard, On that dull November morn, hard, The turkey met his destined end, In a feast, shared with family and friend. So, let us remember that fateful day, As we gather to give thanks and pray, For the turkey, and all creatures, we adore, As we feast and cherish, forevermore.",3067,0,0,0,0,FALSE

19,William Cullen Bryant,25382,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,Man,White,A Forest Hymn,The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned,"The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, And spread the roof above them,---ere he framed The lofty vault, to gather and roll back The sound of anthems; in the darkling wood, Amidst the cool and silence, he knelt down, And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks And supplication. For his simple heart Might not resist the sacred influences, Which, from the stilly twilight of the place, And from the gray old trunks that high in heaven Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound Of the invisible breath that swayed at once All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed His spirit with the thought of boundless power And inaccessible majesty. Ah, why Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore Only among the crowd, and under roofs, That our frail hands have raised? Let me, at least, Here, in the shadow of this aged wood, Offer one hymn---thrice happy, if it find Acceptance in His ear. Father, thy hand Hath reared these venerable columns, thou Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose All these fair ranks of trees. They, in thy sun, Budded, and shook their green leaves in the breeze, And shot towards heaven. The century-living crow, Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died Among their branches, till, at last, they stood, As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dark, Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold Communion with his Maker. These dim vaults, These winding aisles, of human pomp and pride Report not. No fantastic carvings show The boast of our vain race to change the form Of thy fair works. But thou art here---thou fill'st The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds That run along the summit of these trees In music; thou art in the cooler breath That from the inmost darkness of the place Comes, scarcely felt; the barky trunks, the ground, The fresh moist ground, are all instinct with thee. Here is continual worship;---Nature, here, In the tranquility that thou dost love, Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly, around, From perch to perch, the solitary bird Passes; and yon clear spring, that, midst its herbs, Wells softly forth and wandering steeps the roots Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left Thyself without a witness, in these shades, Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak--- By whose immovable stem I stand and seem Almost annihilated---not a prince, In all that proud old world beyond the deep, E'er wore his crown as lofty as he Wears the green coronal of leaves with which Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower With scented breath, and look so like a smile, Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould, An emanation of the indwelling Life, A visible token of the upholding Love, That are the soul of this wide universe.

These frozen skies, Worn by your wings and deafen'd by your cries, Should warn you hence, where milder suns invite, And day alternates with his mother night. You fear perhaps your food will fail you there, Your human carnage, that delicious fare That lured you hither, following still your friend The great Napoleon to the world's bleak end. You fear, because the southern climes pour'd forth Their clustering nations to infest the north, Barvarians, Austrians, those who Drink the Po And those who skirt the Tuscan seas below, With all Germania, Neustria, Belgia, Gaul, Doom'd here to wade thro slaughter to their fall, You fear he left behind no wars, to feed His feather'd canibals and nurse the breed. Fear not, my screamer, call your greedy train, Sweep over Europe, hurry back to Spain, You'll find his legions there; the valliant crew Please best their master when they toil for you. Abundant there they spread the country o'er And taint the breeze with every nation's gore, Iberian, Lussian, British widely strown, But still more wide and copious flows their own. Go where you will; Calabria, Malta, Greece, Egypt and Syria still his fame increase, Domingo's fatten'd isle and India's plains Glow deep with purple drawn from Gallic veins. No Raven's wing can stretch the flight so far As the torn bandrols of Napoleon's war. Choose then your climate, fix your best abode, He'll make you deserts and he'll bring you blood.

The frozen orb, preserving still its form, Defies your talons as it braves the storm, But stands and stares to God, as if to know In what curst hands he leaves his world below. Fly then, or starve; tho all the dreadful road From Minsk to Moskow with their bodies strow'd May count some Myriads, yet they can't suffice To feed you more beneath these dreary skies. Go back, and winter in the wilds of Spain; Feast there awhile, and in the next campaign Rejoin your master; for you'll find him then, With his new million of the race of men, Clothed in his thunders, all his flags unfurl'd, Raging and storming o'er the prostrate world. War after war his hungry soul requires, State after State shall sink beneath his fires, Yet other Spains in victim smoke shall rise And other Moskows suffocate the skies, Each land lie reeking with its people's slain And not a stream run bloodless to the main.

Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of","A POEM IN THREE CANTOS Written at Chambery, in Savoy, January 1793 Omni tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci He makes a good breakfast who mixes pudding with molasses. Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of individuals or the prosperity of a nation, is of more consequence than we are apt to imagine. In recommending so important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wish it were in my power to do it in such a manner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am sensible that it is one of those subjects in which example has infinitely more power than the most convincing arguments or the highest charms of poetry. Goldsmith's Deserted Village, though possessing these two advantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being deserted. The apparent interest of the rich individuals, who form the taste as well as the laws in that country, has been against him; and with that interest it has been vain to contend. The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavor to combat, seem to me not so difficult to cure. No class of people has any interest in supporting them; unless it be the interest which certain families may feel in vying with each other in sumptuous entertainments. There may indeed be some instances of depraved appetites, which no arguments will conquer; but these must be rare. There are very few persons but what would always prefer a plain dish for themselves, and would prefer it likewise for their quests, if there were no risk of reputation in this case. This difficulty can only be removed by example; and the example should proceed from those whose situation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Persons of this description in America, I should hope, are neither above nor below the influence of truth and reason, when conveyed in language suited to the subject. Whether the manner I have chosen to address my arguments to them be such as to promise any success is what I cannot decide. But I certainly had hopes of doing some good, or I should not have taken the pains of putting so many rimes together. The example of domestic virtues has doubtless a great effect. I only wish to rank simplicity of diet among the virtues. In that case I should hope it will be cherished and more esteemed by others than it is at present. THE AUTHOR Canto I Ye Alps audacious, through the heavens that rise, To cramp the day and hide me from the skies; Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurled, Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world, I sing not to you. A softer theme I choose, A virgin theme, unconscious of the muse, But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire The purest frenzy of poetic fire. Despise it not, ye bards to terror steeled, Who hurl your thunders round the epic field; Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing Joys that the vineyard and the stillhouse bring; Or on some distant fair your notes employ, And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy. I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel, My morning incense, and my evening meal, The sweets of Hasty Pudding. Come, dear bowl, Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul. The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine, It's substance mingled, married in with thine, Shall cool and temper thy superior heat, And save the pains of blowing while I eat. Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue, Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime, And, as they roll in substance, roll in rime, No more thy awkward unpoetic name Should shun the muse, or prejudice thy fame; But rising grateful to the accustomed ear, All bards should catch it, and all realms revere! Assist me first with pious toil to trace Through wrecks of time thy lineage and they race; Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore, (Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore) First gave thee to the world; her works of fame Have lived indeed, but lived without a name. Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days, First learned with stones to crack the well-dried maize, Through the rough sieve to shake the golden shower, In boiling water stir the yellow flour: The yellow flour, bestrewed and stirred with haste, Swell in the flood and thickens to a paste, Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim, Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim; The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks, And the whole mass its true consistence takes. Could but her sacred name, unknown so long, Rise, like her labors, to the son of song, To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays, And blow her pudding with the breath of praise. If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before, I here ascribe her one great virtue more. Not through the rich Peruvian realms alone The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known, But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure, Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure. Dear Hasty Pudding, what unpromised joy Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy! Doomed o'er the world through devious paths to roam, Each clime my country, and each house my home, My soul is soothed, my cares have found an end, I greet my long-lost, unforgotten friend. For thee through Paris, that corrupted town, How long in vain I wandered up and down, Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard, Cold from his cave usurps the morning board. London is lost in smoke and steeped in tea; No Yankee there can lisp the name of thee; The uncouth word, a libel on the town, Would call a proclamation from the crown. For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays, Chilled in their fogs, exclude the generous maize; A grain whose rich luxuriant growth requires Short gentle showers, and bright ethereal fires. But here, though distant from our native shore, With mutual glee we meet and laugh once more. The same! I know thee by that yellow face, That strong complexion of true Indian race, Which time can never change, nor soil impair, Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air; For endless years, though every mild domain, Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign. But man, more fickle, the bold incense claims, In different realms to give thee different names. Thee the soft nations round the warm Levant polanta call, the French of course polenta; Ev'n in thy native regions, how I blush To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee mush! On Hudson's banks, while men of Belgic spawn Insult and eat thee by the name suppawn. All spurious appellations, void of truth; I've better known thee from my earliest youth, Thy name is Hasty Pudding! thus our sires Were wont to greet thee fuming from their fires; And while they argued in thy just defence With logic clear, they thus explained the sense: ""In haste the boiling cauldron, o'er the blaze, Receives and cooks the ready-powdered maize; In haste 'tis served, and then in equal haste, With cooling milk, we make the sweet repast. No carving to be done, no knife to grate The tender ear, and wound the stony plate; But the smooth spoon, just fitted to the lip, And taught with art the yielding mass to dip, By frequent journeys to the bowl well stored, Performs the hasty honors of the board."" Such is the name, significant and clear, A name, a sound to every Yankee dear, But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste Preserve my pure hereditary taste. There are who strive to stamp with disrepute The luscious food, because it feeds the brute; In tropes of high-strained wit, while gaudy prigs Compare thy nursling, man, to pampered pigs; With sovereign scorn I treat the vulgar jest, Nor fear to share thy bounties with the beast. What though the generous cow gives me to quaff The milk nutritious; am I then a calf? Or can the genius of the noisy swine, Though nursed on pudding, thence lay claim to mine? Sure the sweet song, I fashion to thy praise, Runs more melodious than the notes they raise. My song resounding in its grateful glee, No merit claims; I praise myself in thee. My father loved thee through his length of days; For thee his fields were shaded o'er with maize; From thee what health, what vigor he possessed, Ten sturdy freemen from his loins attest; Thy constellation ruled my natal morn, And all my bones were made of Indian corn. Delicious grain! whatever form ti take, To roast or boil, to smother or to bake, In every dish 'tis welcome still to me, But most, my Hasty Pudding, most in thee. Let the green succotash with thee contend, let beans and corn their sweetest juices blend, Let butter drench them in its yellow tide, And a long slice of bacon grace their side; Not all the plate, how famed soe'er it be, Can please my palate like a bowl of thee. Some talk of hoe-cake, fair Virginia's pride, Rich johnny-cake this mouth has often tried; Both please me well, their virtues much the same; Alike their fabric, as allied their fame, Except in dear New England, where the last Receives a dash of pumpkin in the paste, To give it sweetness and improve the taste. But place them all before me, smoking hot, The big round dumpling rolling from the pot; The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast, With suet lined, leads on the Yankee feast; The charlotte brown, within whose crusty sides A belly soft the pulpy apple hides; The yellow bread, whose face like amber glows, And all of Indian that the bakepan knows-- You tempt me not--my favorite greets my eyes, To that loved bowl my spoon by instinct flies. Canto II To mix the food by vicious rules of art, To kill the stomach and to sink the heart, To make mankind to social virtue sour, Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour; For this the kitchen muse first framed her book, Commanding sweat to stream from every cook; Children no more their antic gambols tried, And friend to physic wandered why they died. Not so the Yankee--his abundant feast, With simples furnished, and with plainness dressed, A numerous offspring gathers round the board, And cheers alike the servant and the lord; Whose well-bought hunger prompts the joyous taste, And health attends them from the short repast. While the full pail rewards the milkmaid's toil, The mother sees the morning cauldron boil; To stir the pudding next demands their care, To spread the table and the bowls prepare; To feed the children, as their portions cool, And comb their heads, and send them off to school. Yet may the simplest dish some rules impart, For nature scorns not all the aids of art. Ev'n Hasty Pudding, purest of all food, May still be bad, indifferent, or good, As sage experience the short process guides, Or want of skill, or want of care presides: Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan, To rear the child and long sustain the man; To shield the morals while it mends the size, And all the powers of every food supplies, Attend the lessons that the muse shall bring. Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing. But since, O man! thy life and health demand Not food alone, but labor from thy hand, First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays, Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize; She loves the race that courts her yielding soil, And gives her bounties to the sons of toil. When now the ox, obedient to thy call, Repays the loan that filled the winter stall, Pursue his traces o'er the furrowed plain, And plant in measured hills the golden grain. But when the tender germ begins to shoot, And the green spire declares the sprouting root, Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe, The insidious worm, the all-devouring crow. A little ashes, sprinkled round the spire, Son steeped in rain, will bid the worm retire; The feathered robber with his hungry maw Swift flies the field before your man of straw, A frightful image, such as schoolboys bring When met to burn the Pope or hang the King. Thrice in the season, through each verdant row Wield the strong plowshare and the faithful hoe; The faithful hoe, a double task that takes, To till the summer corn, and roast the winter cakes. Slow springs the blade, while checked by chilling rains, Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains; But when his fiercest fires emblaze the land, Then start the juices, then the roots expand; Then, like a column of Corinthian mold, The stalk struts upward, and the leaves unfold; The busy branches all the ridges fill, Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill. Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done; Leave the last labors to the parent sun; Beneath his genial smiles the well-dressed field, When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield. Now the strong foliage bears the standards high, And shoots the tall top-gallants to the sky; The suckling ears their silky fringes bend, And pregnant grown, their swelling coats distend; The loaded stalk, while still the burden grows, O'erhangs the space that runs between the rows; High as a hop-field waves the silent grove, A safe retreat for little thefts of love, When the pledged roasting-ears invite the maid, To meet her swain beneath the new-formed shade; His generous hand unloads the cumbrous hill, And the green spoils her ready basket fill; Small compensation for the two-fold bliss, The promised wedding and the present kiss. Slight depredations these; but now the moon Calls from his hollow tree the sly raccoon; And while by night he bears his prize away, The bolder squirrel labors through the day. Both thieves alike, but provident of time, A virtue rare, that almost hides their crime. Then let them steal the little stores they can, And fill their granaries from the toils of man; We've one advantage where they take no part, With all their wiles they ne'er have found the art To boil the Hasty Pudding; here we shine Superior far to tenants of the pine; This envied boon to man shall still belong, Unshared by them in substance or in song. At last the closing season browns the plain, And ripe October gathers in the grain; Deep loaded carts the spacious corn-house fill, The sack distended marches to the mill; The laboring mill beneath the burden grounds, And showers the future pudding from the stones; Till the glad housewife greets the powdered gold, And the new crop exterminates the old. Canto III The days grow short; but though the falling sun To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done, Night's pleasing shades his various talk prolong, And yield new subjects to my various song. For now, the corn-house filled, the harvest home, The invited neighbors to the husking come; A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play, Unite their charms, to chase the hours away. Where the huge heap lies centered in the hall, The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall, Brown corn-fed nymphs, and strong hard-handed beaux, Alternate ranged, extend in circling rows, Assume their seats, the solid mass attack; The dry husks rustle, and the corncobs crack; The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound, And the sweet cider trips in silence round. The laws of husking every wight can tell; And sure no laws he ever keeps so well: For each red ear a general kiss he gains, With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains; But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast, Red as her lips, and taper as her waist, She walks the round, and culls one favored beau, Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow. Various the sport, as are the wits and brains Of well-pleased lasses and contending swains; Till the vast mound of corn is swept away, And he that gets the last ear wins the day. Meanwhile the housewife urges all her care, The well-earned feast to hasten and prepare. The sifted meal already waits her hand, The milk is strained, the bowls in order stand, The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes The headlong stream that o'er the milldam breaks) Foams, roars, and rages with incessant toils, So the vexed cauldron rages, roars, and boils. First with clean salt she seasons well the food, Then strews the flour, and thickens all the flood. Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand; To stir it well demands a stronger hand; The husband takes his turn; and round and round The ladle flies; at last the toil is crowned; When to the board the thronging huskers our, And take their seats as at the corn before. I leave them to their feat. There still belong More copious matters to my faithful song. For rules there are, though ne'er unfolded yet, Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate. Some with molasses line the luscious treat, And mix, like bards, the useful with the sweet. A wholesome dish, and well deserving praise, A great resource in those bleak wintry days, When the chilled earth lies buried deep in snow, And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow. Blessed cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ, Mother of Egypt's God--but sure, for me, Were I to leave my God, I'd worship thee. How oft thy teats these pious hands have pressed! How oft thy bounties proved my only feast! How oft I've fed thee with my favorite grain! And roared, like thee, to find thy children slain! Ye swains who know her various worth to prize, Ah! house her well from winter's angry skies. Potatoes, pumpkins, should her sadness cheer, Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer; When spring returns she'll well acquaint the loan, And nurse at once your infants and her own. Milk then with pudding I should always choose; To this in future I confine my muse, Till she in haste some further hints unfold, Well for the young, nor useless to the old. First in your bowl the milk abundant take, Then drop with are along the silver lake Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide; But when their growing mass no more can sink, When the soft island looms above the brink, Then check your hand; you've got the portion's due, So taught our sires, and what they taught is true. There is a choice in spoons. Though small appear The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear. The deep-bowled Gallie spoon, contrived to scoop In ample draughts the thin diluted soup, Performs not well in those substantial things, Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings; Where the strong labial muscles must embrace, The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space. With ease to enter and discharge the freight, A bowl less concave but still more dilate, Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size, A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes. Experienced feeders can alone impart A rule so much above the lore of art. These tuneful lips that thousand spoons have tried, With just precision could the point decide, Though not in song; the muse but poorly shines In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines; Yet the true form, as near as she can tell, Is that small section of a goose-egg shell, Which in two equal portions shall divide The distance from the center to the side. Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin. Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me, Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee; Just in the zenith your wise head project, Your full spoon, rising in a line direct, Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall, The wide-mouthed bowl will surely catch them all.",https://mypoeticside.com/show-classic-poem-1965,"A Poem in Three Cantos Canto I Ye Alps audacious, through the heavens that rise, To cramp the day and hide me from the skies; Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurl'd, Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world, I sing not you. A softer theme I choose, A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse, But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire The purest frenzy of poetic fire. Despise it not, ye bards to terror steel'd, Who hurl your thunders round the epic field; Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing Joys that the vineyard and the stillhouse bring; Or on some distant fair your notes employ, And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy. I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel, My morning incense, and my evening meal, The sweets of Hasty Pudding. Come, dear bowl, Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul. The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine, Its substance mingled, married, with the wine. Through life's dull road, still dreaming on the sweets Of climes departed, and of former treats, Such as my hospitable pipe bestow'd On my rapt soul, while in his company I husbanded the source of future joy, And, smoking, scribbled, like an ancient Sibyl; Or when the friendly and the honest bowl Was circling round, and harmony was soul— Gently, O gently, thus have none express'd The transports that you feel, the joy you taste, When, by permission of indulgent fate, Sweet food and gentle gales our hours elate. When the full stomach longs its aid to join To wines that sparkle, and to wit that shines, Celestial food, harmonious powers, combined To fill the soul and tune the empty mind. Celestial Muse, my arduous flight sustain And raise my mind to a seraphic strain! Canto II The sweets of Hasty Pudding thus endear: But now, ye Curls that wave, and ye who wear, Favonian gales, smooth be your wanton course, Glide swiftly to fulfil my fond desire, Spread o'er his ample back, and with a touch Divinely smooth, the weary swain bedew: Ye watery Nymphs that in the bottom dwell, Deep in whose waters stands my humble cell, Haste to the court of W——, and say I came By His command your choicest sweets to bring. In robe of state, high on his regal seat, He reigns, the Monarch of his blest retreat. At his command we perish or we play, Nor when in rage he gives our life, dismayed, Die at his feet—disdaining to complain, We start to life and gladly breathe again. He gives the word, the obedient surface flows And, taught by him, the new-made river goes, Graceful and winding, where his finger leads; But where these waters stagnate, soon recedes. To secret channels his commands impart, Which down the surface gently steal apart, By his command they work their hidden way, And, serving him, with equal tribute pay. Moss, pumice, and the scoria’s mimic face, And black, red, azure, and the watery glass, On the skin's field their mingling colours blend To form a picture which his finger guides: It was a landscape in its full design, Where hills and dales, and fields and meadows join. Heaven, earth, and water in one view combine, And see the streams along the valley run A silver brook, meandering to the sun: On whose bright surface, with reflected beams, Bards sing, and bathing nymphs dissolve in dreams. Dress, colonel-like, in complete regimentals, Yon whisker'd cornet who the bunch presents, He with his band of trainees come, With four-in-hand that wring, and others go, To play for tickets at the rareeshow; But this first-rater in the sportive art, Takes his departure with the tablecloth, And leaves the floor to waiters and to wait. O'er chairs and tables the silk streamers glide, And spread their colours round on every side; Where-e'er we sit, they shoot their golden threads; With such effect the sun bright colours spreads On gems and paintings, and the gilded groves, Where-e'er we go, his splendour shines around, For, since the time that Nimrod and his crew Forsook the plains and to the forest flew, I never saw a Pudding yet that knew, With it five thousand guests have entertained; To equal this have art and labour strain'd. Gently, O gently, thus have none express'd The transports that you feel, the joys you taste, When, by permission of indulgent fate, Sweet food and gentle gales our hours elate.

How bless'd my lot!—But there's a maid,",15426,"A POEM IN THREE CANTOS Written at Chambery, in Savoy, January 1793 Omni tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci He makes a good breakfast who mixes pudding with molasses. Preface A simplicity in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of man or the political well-being of society, is a doctrine which, in these extraordinary times, is loudly called for. The experience of the most enlightened nations has confirmed the wisdom of this theory in the latter point of view; and there is a great probability that the improvement of the moral character of mankind would receive a powerful impulse from the general adoption of the precept in the former. Savoy, the country where the following Poem was composed, is one of those secluded spots which the God of Nature seems to have chosen for the peaceful abode of simplicity and contentment. When the great Sovereign of the universe gave to mankind abundance and beauty in the productions of the earth, He seems to have intended that they should have, in one corner of the world at least, a fair opportunity of enjoying them. Thus He spread with peculiar profusion the fertile bosom of Savoy with every valuable product, embellished it with the most magnificent scenery, and gave its inhabitants a temperament which disposes them to admire and enjoy the delightful objects around them. It is difficult to conceive a region more happily adapted to a state of Arcadian simplicity. The tremendous barriers of Nature which surround it, and exclude it, as it were, from the rest of the world, conduce to the preservation of its innocence, while the mild character of its inhabitants would excite a wish that they should never be called forth to mingle in the corruptions of an ambitious and intriguing world. To these circumstances I must attribute the very flattering attention which the following Poem has received in the place where it was written; for the pleasing indulgence of the literary circles at Chambery I am greatly indebted, and shall ever retain the most grateful recollection of it. I must not, however, disguise from the reader, that although the Poem be appropriate to the situation in which it was composed, and partakes of the nature of its scenery, yet it may possess but little interest for the generality of readers. Its subjects are minute, and it is principally indebted for any grace it may possess to the feelings of friendship with which it was begun, and to the impressions of simplicity with which it was terminated. Canto I I Along the banks where Babel's current flows His tuneful shell a youthful shepherd found; Its poor inhabitant, his only ewes, While grateful flocks stood listening around, Caroled his native ditty. Soft, through night The Zephyrs whispering bore it to the height Of Solyma's proud temple, thence rebounds To Salem's ancient towers, and sacred holy ground. II Awake, he sung; and while his trembling string His little country and his mistress praised, He little thought his notes should ever bring An English wanderer in the Muses' maze To muse on his wild song. He thought not then The sacred well would echo back again, And many a weary footstep come this way, To gather inspiration from thy lay. III For oft, indulging in poetic dreams, I seek the haunts of our forefathers' fame; And oft, where kindred genius never beams, With vain attempts a fadeless wreath I claim; Then turning, tell my fruitless tale to prove My distant scene unfitted for the Muse, While musing still, I hear the nightly strain Of what I could have wished, but cannot, sing. IV Whate'er the spot whereon I chance to dwell Each native note still wakes a kindred flame; I feel the magic of my subject swell My simple song, and gives it power and fame. Thus far my little bark with friendly gales Has skimmed the shore and listened to the wales Which playful echo from the neighboring bay, When once she dares attempt to plough the watery way. V But vainly for the clime my vessel strives, She has no compass, not a sail of skill; And, when she ventures on the deep, she drives Before each wind, and only fears the ill. Then guide me, Folly, be my suns, my stars, My charts, my compass, whisper all my airs; Ye powers of rhyme and rhythm, swell my sails, Then blow, ye Muses, blow your favors on my gales.",15745,"the individual or the well-being of society, is a virtue that has been extolled by sages and philosophers throughout the ages. In an era where excess and extravagance seem to reign, it is worth pausing to reflect on the joys of simple fare and the harmonious balance it brings to our lives. Canto I In Chambery's embrace, where snow-capped peaks, Frame a landscape serene, where wisdom speaks, I find solace in a humble abode, Where simplicity reigns, and contentment's bestowed. A table spread with modest grace, A meal prepared, a warm embrace. No lavish feasts or opulent display, Just simple fare to brighten the day. A crust of bread, a bowl of broth, A humble repast, yet fills us both. In moderation, pleasure's found, A virtue that wisdom does astound. Canto II Amidst the mountains' grand embrace, I wander through this tranquil space, Where nature's bounty, pure and fair, Is mirrored in my simple fare. With fruits and grains, the earth provides, A feast for heart and soul besides. No need for excess or greed to grow, In harmony with nature, we shall glow. A taste of honey, a sip of wine, A moment's joy, a gift divine. For in this union of sweet and pure, I find a happiness that will endure. Canto III As I bid Chambery adieu, A wisdom newfound, I take with me too. In blending pudding with molasses' touch, I've learned a lesson that means so much. To mix the useful with the sweet, In life's pursuits, find balance neat. For in simplicity's embrace, We find contentment, and blessings grace. So let us savor each humble morsel, In life's journey, be kind and moral. With simple joys, let us befriend, And find true happiness till the end.",17572,0,0,0,0,FALSE

He saw, once more, bright Del'ware's silver stream, And Penn's throng'd city cast a cheerful gleam; The dome of state, that met his eager eye, Now heav'd its arches in a loftier sky. The bursting gates unfold: and lo, within, A solemn train in conscious glory shine. The well-known forms his eye had trac'd before, In diff'rent realms along th' extended shore; Here, grac'd with nobler fame, and rob'd in state, They look'd and mov'd magnificently great. High on the foremost seat, in living light, Majestic Randolph caught the hero's sight: Fair on his head, the civic crown was plac'd, And the first dignity his sceptre grac'd. He opes the cause, and points in prospect far, Thro' all the toils that wait th' impending war -- But, hapless sage, thy reign must soon be o'er, To lend thy lustre, and to shine no more. So the bright morning star, from shades of ev'n, Leads up the dawn, and lights the front of heav'n, Points to the waking world the sun's broad way, Then veils his own, and shines above the day. And see great Washington behind thee rise, Thy following sun, to gild our morning skies; O'er shadowy climes to pour the enliv'ning flame, The charms of freedom and the fire of fame. Th' ascending chief adorn'd his splendid seat, Like Randolph, ensign'd with a crown of state; Where the green patriot bay beheld, with pride, The hero's laurel springing by its side; His sword, hung useless, on his graceful thigh, On Britain still he cast a filial eye; But sov'reign fortitude his visage bore, To meet their legions on th' invaded shore. Sage Franklin next arose, in awful mien, And smil'd, unruffled, o'er th' approaching scene; High, on his locks of age, a wreath was brac'd, Palm of all arts, that e'er a mortal grac'd; Beneath him lies the sceptre kings have borne, And crowns and laurels from their temples torn. Nash, Rutledge, Jefferson, in council great, And Jay and Laurens op'd the rolls of fate. The Livingstons, fair Freedom's gen'rous band, The Lees, the Houstons, fathers of the land, O'er climes and kingdoms turn'd their ardent eyes, Bade all th' oppressed to speedy vengeance rise; All pow'rs of state, in their extended plan, Rise from consent to shield the rights of man. Bold Wolcott urg'd the all-important cause; With steady hand the solemn scene he draws; Undaunted firmness with his wisdom join'd, Nor kings nor worlds could warp his stedfast mind. Now, graceful rising from his purple throne, In radiant robes, immortal Hosmer shone; Myrtles and bays his learned temples bound, The statesman's wreath, the poet's garland crown'd: Morals and laws expand his liberal soul, Beam from his eyes, and in his accents roll. But lo! an unseen hand the curtain drew, And snatch'd the patriot from the hero's view; Wrapp'd in the shroud of death, he sees descend The guide of nations and the muses' friend. Columbus dropp'd a tear. The angel's eye Trac'd the freed spirit mounting thro' the sky. Adams, enrag'd, a broken charter bore, And lawless acts of ministerial pow'r; Some injur'd right in each loose leaf appears, A king in terrors and a land in tears; From all the guileful plots the veil he drew, With eye retortive look'd creation through; Op'd the wide range of nature's boundless plan, Trac'd all the steps of liberty and man; Crowds rose to vengeance while his accents rung, And Independence thunder'd from his tongue.",https://poetandpoem.com/Joel-Barlow/The-First-American-Congress,"I apologize, but it seems there is an error in the request again.

The God beheld his votaries with a frown, And the pale coursers turned their heads and neighed. Then, rising wrathful, ""Hence, ye coward race, False to your friend, and traitors to my grace! Begone, nor bathe in my forbidden spring; Nor this my great, my wondrous secret sing."" He spoke in thunders: the devoted throng In silent sadness owned the sentence just; Then sought with streaming eyes their ancient bound, And now unseen, and wailing as they went, Shun the dire cavern and its mouth of stone. 'Twas night; the sound of torrents ceased to roar, And silence brooded on the dusky plain; When, thronging from all points, a piercing cry The fearful silence of that hour awoke. ""Fly, fly,"" they cried, ""the water spirits come; And vengeance flashes from their angry eyes!"" The listening crowd beheld a watery arch, Fantastic in the moon's refracted rays, High and portentous, o'er their heads display The semblance of an hundred bending bows; From side to side the twinkling tree-tops flashed, And the long river glimmered as it flowed. Soon from the arch a host of shadows sprung, That full of wrath, and pointing, sought the shore. At first they stood, of human shape and size, Then grew by swift degrees to giant forms; And soon, their stature and their visage changed, Their shoulders reared, their azure arms, upflung, And the hoarse flood rolled through the ranks of war. Fear, not the fear of death, in every eye Appeared; they gazed, they trembled, and they fled; The broad immeasurable stream they crossed, And now, beyond its opposite bank, appeared, Wildered in flight, the scattered multitude. A guard of fifty youths, with guardian arms, Protected our forefathers, and preserved The inviolated heralds of our song, Long-haired and beautiful in manly grace, Whose looks denoted their heroic souls.",2475,"In awe, Columbus gazed upon the vast expanse, From south to north, the immeasurable shade did enhance. The uncharted waters, mysterious and unknown, A journey into the horizon, he was sown. With courage in his heart, and hope as his guide, He ventured forth, with the oceans as wide. Through the boundless seas, his ship did sail, Discovering new lands, a brave explorer's tale. The shades of uncertainty, a daunting sight, Yet, onward he pressed, with determination's light. In search of riches, of new lands to claim, A vision of glory, a dream to proclaim. From south to north, the shadows fell, In the unknown, where stories would dwell. Columbus, the navigator, on this quest, Found a new world, with wonder blessed. With open eyes, and a vision clear, He saw a future that was far and near. His voyage, a testament of human might, In the face of darkness, he brought forth light.",2881,0,0,0,0,FALSE
